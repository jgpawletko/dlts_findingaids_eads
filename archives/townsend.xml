            <abstract id="ref2" label="Abstract">In 1941, New York University Professor Atwood H. Townsend surveyed a number of prominent writers, economists, historians, journalist, and commentators on what they believed to be essential reading materials. With the feedback he received, Townsend compiled "Good Reading: A Guide for Serious Readers" as a suggested guideline of important titles for readers among a diversity of fields. The University Archives holds a number of returned questionnaires as well as Townsend's correspondence with participants.</abstract>

            <p>Atwood Townsend was born in Moorestown, New Jersey, in 1897. He received his education from Boys High School in Brooklyn and his degree from New York University. He contributed significantly to the field of educational research and accepted a position as Professor of English at the New York University School of Engineering in 1918. Dr. Townsend chaired a committee on college reading for the National Council of Teachers of English in 1933. For the council, he created a list of the top 100 most significant books for college readers, polling professors and other academics to compile a substantial guideline for students. In 1943 Dr. Townsend acted as executive secretary for the third Free World Congress in New York. He remained a professor of English at NYU until his retirement in 1961. He died in 1967.</p>
