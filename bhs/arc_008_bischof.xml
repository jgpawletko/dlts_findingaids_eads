            <p>George J. Bischof (1866-1953) was employed as a civil engineer for the Harlem River Bridge Commission in Manhattan, N.Y. in 1887, and joined the New York City Department of Parks in 1889. As a result of the consolidation of the five New York City boroughs, Bischof was transferred to the Office of the Brooklyn Borough President in 1902. In Brooklyn, Bischof served as an engineer for local boards of the Bureau of Sewers and the Topographical Bureau, where he remained until his retirement in 1936.</p>
