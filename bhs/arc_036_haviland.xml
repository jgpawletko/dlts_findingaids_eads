            <p>Frank Haviland was born on September 12, 1847 in Purchase, N.Y. and resided at 66 Willow Street in Brooklyn, N.Y. as an adult. Though he worked for the Haviland family business--importing fine china from Limoges, France--Frank Haviland also followed in the footsteps of his first cousin Frederick Haviland and conducted extensive genealogical research on his and other Quaker families. This work resulted in several cemetery inscription lists and membership rolls of Quaker meetings throughout the northeastern United States. In 1906, Haviland moved to Holliston, M.A., where he became active in the local historical society and remained until his death on January 6, 1920.</p>
