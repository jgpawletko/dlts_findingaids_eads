            <p>The Minnie Grace Hillard collection is primarily focused on Brevoort Savings Bank, its employees and history. The collection includes correspondence, promotional material, publications, and a bank history collected by Hillard during her career at Brevoort Savings Bank. The history of the bank includes reminiscences from and biographical information on bank officers. A guest book from Hillard's father's funeral contains the signatures of several bank officers.</p>
            <p>Six photographs show Minnie Grace Hillard and her colleagues at Brevoort Savings Bank, including John Crimmins of the Auditing Department, Barry Donohue of the Life Insurance Department, and Chairman of the Board Terence Smith. One photograph does not relate to Hillard's time at the bank--a circa 1925 class portrait at P.S. 93, which includes Hillard.</p>

            <head>Biographical note</head>
            <p>Minnie Grace Hillard was a Brooklyn native; born in the borough on January 15, 1918, she attended P.S. 93 in Bedford-Stuyvesant. In 1935, at the age of 17, she began work at the Brooklyn-based Brevoort Savings Bank. Notably, Hillard was appointed as one of the first female officers of the bank and the first female vice president in July 1965. She retired after 41 years of service. Late in her tenure with the institution, the bank merged with and became known as Metropolitan Savings Bank, which was again changed to Crossland Savings Bank in 1985. Hillard died in Rhinebeck, N.Y. in 1998.</p>
