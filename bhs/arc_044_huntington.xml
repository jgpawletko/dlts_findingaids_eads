            <p>Edna Huntington (1895-1965) attended P.S. 131 in Brooklyn and later completed Columbia University's Home Study courses in Librarianship. She began working for the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) in 1926 and served as Head Librarian from 1936 to 1960. In addition to her work as a librarian, Huntington was an avid traveler. During the 1920s and 1930s, she planned a number of hiking and camping trips throughout the northeast United States and documented her excursions with photographs and detailed travel journals.</p>
