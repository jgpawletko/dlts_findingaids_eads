            <p>The Finney family papers contain items mainly pertaining to the career and personal life of William Finney, though there is a small number of items pertaining to William's brother, Peter, as well as Ellen Phinney, a family relative (possibly William and Peter's mother). The collection spans the period circa 1865 to 1913, with the majority of the items dating from the 1890s and the first decade of the 1900s. Items relating to William Finney include personal correspondence, notebooks and journals in which William recorded financial transactions and business and personal errands, business and calling cards, a stock certificate issued by the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, receipts, news clippings pertaining to various companies and business ventures in which William was interested or involved, photographs, documentation regarding William's purchasing of a plot of land at Green-Wood Cemetery, and a notice regarding William's date of death and the filing of his will. Items relating to Peter Finney include an obituary and photographs. An additional photograph depicts Ellen Phinney.</p>

            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>William Finney (1831-1913) was a prominent Brooklyn citizen who lived at 558 Putnam Avenue with his brother, Peter (1833-1902). William was a businessman who, along with Henry Hoffman, ran the Brooklyn company Finney &amp; Hoffman, a manufacturer of steam boilers and engines located on Water Street between Bridge and Jay Streets. Though the collection does not testify as to the degree of William's formal scientific training, it is evident that he possessed significant knowledge of the field, as he was also an associate member of the Department of Microscopy at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. William was also involved in several business ventures throughout Brooklyn, including being a shareholder of the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, the Brooklyn City Railroad Co., and the Long Island Traction Company.</p>
            <p>Peter Finney (1833-1902), William's brother, was a shipbuilder and oarsman working under George Steers of New York. He helped build the yacht
