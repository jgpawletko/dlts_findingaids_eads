            <p>The Limbert family collection contains three autograph albums bearing handwritten inscriptions. One album, belonging to Anna Cristina Thorer, contains entries from friends for the years 1886 and 1889. The other two albums belong to Anna's daughter, Christina Limbert. Of these, one contains entries from family members and friends for the period January 1907 to May 1908, and the other bears the inscription "To Crissie, from Aunt Agnes, September 30th, 1907" and contains entries from friends and classmates spanning the period November 1908 to January 1909. The typical entry in all three albums consists of a short personalized message, often humorous, poetic, or alluding to religious ideas, along with the signature of its author. The collection also includes six tintype photographs of unidentified members of the Limbert family taken at a Coney Island studio, circa 1900, which are separately housed in the tintype collection.</p>

            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>The Limbert family resided at 469 Ovington Avenue in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bay Ridge, in a house built by Nathaniel Thorer, a furrier and artist who emigrated to New York from Prussia. Thorer purchased the property in 1854 and built the house in 1859. He and his wife had six children, one of whom was Anna Cristina Thorer (1871-1964), who married Jesse Tanton Limbert in October of 1894. The Limberts had two daughters, Elsie (b. 1898) and Christina (ca. 1896-1985), who attended Public School 102 in Bay Ridge. As an adult Christina was active in the Bay Ridge Historical Society. Neither Elsie nor Christina married, and Elsie, who lived in the house at 469 Ovington Avenue her entire life, willed the house to the Lutheran Church located at 4th and Ovington Avenues in Bay Ridge.</p>
