            <p>John McTernan was a Brooklyn resident who served in the SeaBees, the United States Navy's Construction Batallions, during World War II. He had been employed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard prior to the start of the War, and before engaging in wartime service, he was able to secure a job at the Navy Yard for his father. McTernan returned to work at the Navy Yard after the War's end. He was a member of the Catholic Men's League of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.</p>
