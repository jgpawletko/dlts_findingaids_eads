            <head>Historical note</head>
            <p>The Morning Choral Society was founded in 1919 by Herbert Stavely Sammond (1871-1964) as a non-sectarian women’s amateur vocal group. The group’s regular activities included two major annual concerts in the spring and winter. During the group's early years, rehearsals were held on Tuesday mornings, and then on Wednesday mornings and Monday evenings during its later period. Sammond acted as organist and conductor until his retirement in 1948. The Society was also involved with social events and fundraisers such as annual Spring luncheons and card parties. Howard Kasschan took over as conductor in 1949. The Society voted to disband at its annual meeting in 1962.</p>
