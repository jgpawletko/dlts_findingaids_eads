            <p>The origins of the Brooklyn Navy Yard (officially known as the New York Naval Shipyard) date back to 1801, when the United States Navy acquired what had previously been a small, privately owned shipyard in order to construct naval vessels. By the time the Defense Department ceased shipbuilding activities at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1966, 88 vessels had been manufactured at the facility. In 1967, the Brooklyn Navy Yard was acquired by the City of New York and was converted for private commercial use.</p>

            <p>The papers include several original issues of the Brooklyn Navy Yard's newspaper, 
                <emph render="italic">The Shipworker</emph>, from the years 1950, 1957 and 1959, as well as two photocopies of issues of 
                <emph render="italic">The Shipworker</emph> from 1955 and 1958. Also included are a reduction in force notice addressed to Joseph Raggio, a Machinist Marine employed at the Navy Yard. This document is dated January 22, 1965, which coincides with the time period during which the Navy Yard was closed by the Department of Defense. The two photographs included with the papers depict award ceremonies honoring employees of the Navy Yard and are dated 1957 and 1962, respectively. Joseph Raggio is depicted in the 1957 photograph.</p>
