            <p>Three generations of the George Morgan family lived in Brooklyn, N.Y. during the late 19th century. George (d. 1895) and Caroline E. Morgan (d. circa 1896) resided at 119 Halsey Street in the present-day neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant. Thomas and Charlotte Musson (d. 1933) Morgan lived at 1173 Bushwick Avenue in Bushwick, along with their children Charlotte E. (1882-1961) and Thomas C. (b. circa 1884) Morgan.</p>

            <p>The Morgan family papers, dated 1883 to 1929, contain ephemera and photographs from Thomas Morgan and members of his family. Items include two merit rewards from P.S. 56 to Thomas C. Morgan, as well as a merit reward from an unidentified school; an admission ticket to the St. George Swimming Club, located at the Hotel St. George; a map of sewers on Bushwick Avenue between Vigelius Street (now known as Jefferson Avenue) and Woodbine Street, denoting the home of Thomas and Charlotte Morgan; and a court order to Charlotte E. Morgan regarding the estate of George Morgan, presumably Thomas C. and Charlotte E. Morgan's grandfather. Photographs in the collection include four images of the Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods in Brooklyn: two prints of the Morgan home at 1173 Bushwick Avenue; one print of the Bushwick Avenue Congregational Church; and a group portrait of students at P.S. 26, located at the time in Bedford-Stuyvesant near Quincy Street.</p>
