            <p>Materials on the 1939 New York World's Fair were donated by Lewis N. Anderson, Jr., Wesley Baker, Mrs. James H. Durgin, Herbert S. Hale, and Mrs. Ross Miner, 1966; Millicent Mullineux, 1977; and John B. Shiel, date unknown.</p>
            <p>Materials on the 1964 New York World's Fair were largely collected by staff members of the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) who attended the Fair. A smaller number of items were donated by the New York World's Fair 1964 Corporation, date unknown.</p>

            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>The site for both the 1939 and 1964 World's Fairs was Flushing Meadows Park in Flushing, Queens, N.Y. Extensive work was done before the 1939 Fair to convert the site from its previous existence as a giant ash heap to a suitable park, fairgrounds and exhibition site. Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, who was to play a large role in the 1964 World's Fair plans, was involved in ensuring that the community would get a usable park after the Fair was over.</p>
            <p>Despite the Great Depression and instability in Europe, engineer Joseph F. Shagden and Edward F. Roosevelt, cousin to United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt, began to plan in 1935 for a 1939 World's Fair to take place in New York City, its purpose being to "celebrate the 150th anniversary of the inauguration of George Washington and the launching of the new American government under the Constitution." The 1939 theme, "Building the World of Tomorrow," had as its grand architectural symbols an immense white sphere called the Perisphere and a triangular obelisk called the Trylon. A special attraction called "Democracity," illustrating the delights of a city of the future, was also a highlight of the exhibition. The Fair ran from April 30, 1939, to October 31, 1939, and then from May 11, 1940, to October 27, 1940. Dozens of countries participated, building grand pavilions to present their cultures and traditions to all Fair attendees. In addition, scores of businesses presented exhibits showcasing new wares and products, including the American companies General Electric, Consolidated Edison, and the National Broadcasting Corporation. Masterpieces of Renaissance art were also shown in art exhibitions, while the popular "Town of Tomorrow" showed fifteen demonstration homes, each designed to appeal to a different taste.</p>
            <p>Decades later, another World's Fair took place on the same site. Parks Commissioner Robert Moses became president of the New York World's Fair Corporation and was instrumental in the pre-planning phases and implementation of improvements to the site. Construction on Shea Stadium (then known as Flushing Meadow Park Municipal Stadium and later demolished in 2009) also began at this time. Moses's interest in the World's Fair site coincided with a decision from the same time period to decline to support construction of a new stadium for the Brooklyn Dodgers.</p>
            <p>The 1964 World's Fair ran from April 22, 1964, to October 18, 1964, and then from April 21, 1965, to October 17, 1965. Its theme was "Man in a Shrinking Globe in an Expanding Universe," an idea that seemed appropriate in the newly arrived space age. The architectural symbol of this fair was the Unisphere, which can still be viewed on the former site today. As with the previous fair, country pavilions showcased their cultures and cuisines, and business and industry exhibits showed products and innovations.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>The New York World's Fair collection is composed of eleven manuscript boxes, one oversize flat box, and two artifact boxes totaling 6.35 linear feet and covering the periods 1936 to 1940 and 1960 to 1965. The collection has been arranged into three series:</p>
            <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
                <item>1964 Fair</item>
                <item>1939 Fair</item>
                <item>Duplicates</item>
            </list>
            <p>Series 1 constitutes Boxes 1 and 2, Artifact Box 2, and some items in the oversize box. Items include preliminary reports and planning documents detailing the work to be done on the Fair site in Flushing Meadows Park. The maps and photographs in these reports provide valuable documentation of the extent of the planning and improvements made to the park.</p>
            <p>Series 2 contains nearly all of the remaining 9 manuscript boxes, Artifact Box 1, and items in the oversize box, and has been divided into 5 subseries: 
                <emph render="italic">Theatrical and film productions</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Exhibitions</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Travel guides</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Miscellaneous printed material</emph>, and 
                <emph render="italic">Guide books</emph>. The subseries 
                <emph render="italic">Travel guides</emph>, consisting of travel brochures to individual American states and to countries around the world, is perhaps the most prominent subseries. The 
                <emph render="italic">Miscellaneous printed material</emph> subseries is also substantial and consists of memorabilia and artifacts such as restaurant menus, invitations to opening day ceremonies, packets of souvenir Fair tickets, and three sticks of Wrigley's chewing gum, along with many more items. Two copies of a 35 mm film reel entitled "Come to the Fair" are also included in Series 1.</p>
            <p>Series 3, consisting solely of duplicate items, occupies only the final folder in Box 11. In the instance of duplicate items in the collection, three copies of each item were left in their original folder, while the remaining duplicates were moved to the Series 3 folder.</p>
