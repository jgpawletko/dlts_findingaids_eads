            <p>Emma Toedteberg (1857-1936) joined the staff of the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) at the age of 13. Following the tenure of George Hannah, she served as the Society's third librarian from 1889 until her death. Toedteberg was an avid proponent of animal rights and a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Nativity in Brooklyn. She also inherited from her father a passion for collecting bookplates.</p>
            <p>Augustus Toedteberg (1824-1909), her father, emigrated from Germany in 1844 and worked as an inlay illustrator in New York City. He married fellow German immigrant Catherine Lager (d. 1905) in New York City in 1849. In addition to Emma, the couple had another daughter, Louise Toedteberg (1853-1938). The family resided at 274 Vanderbilt Avenue in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, and later at 628 East Delmere Place (now known as East 23rd Street) in Flatbush.</p>

                    <p>The earliest document in the series is Augustus Toedteberg and Catherine Lager's marriage certificate, followed by christening certificates, written in German. These christening certificates indicate Augustus and Catherine had two or three children prior to Emma and Louise who died in early childhood. A deed to a Green-Wood Cemetery plot addressed to Augustus Toedteberg suggests that these infants were buried together in a Toedteberg family plot. Clippings in the series discuss Augustus and Emma's voyages to Europe, Emma Toedteberg's work at the Long Island Historical Society, and the disposition of her bookplate collection after her death. Correspondence and LIHS board minutes also touch upon Emma's contributions and legacy at LIHS.</p>
