            <p>The Richard Salter Storrs family collection, dated 1764 to 1900, contains sermons, lectures, correspondence, and a listing of accounts belonging to Rev. Richard Salter Storrs and his great-grandfather, Rev. John Storrs. Materials include Richard Salter Storrs's 1863 sermon, "How Our Gratitude to God for His Goodness to the Nation is Manifested," his 1874 sermon titled "Ruth and Naomi," and his lecture from the late 19th century titled "Colony of Massachusetts Bay." Correspondence, dated 1851 to 1893, is addressed to either the Rev. Richard Salter Storrs or Mrs. Mary Storrs; one notable correspondent is Rev. Henry Ward Beecher. Several invitations to Rev. Storrs, dated 1878, request that he deliver a lecture titled "The Ottomon and the Muscovite: Their Long Dual" at the New York Academy of Music. Lastly, a document from Rev. John Storrs lists his account with the First Society of Southold, Long Island between 1764 and 1786.</p>
