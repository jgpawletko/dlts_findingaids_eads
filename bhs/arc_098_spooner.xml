            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Alden Spooner (1783-1848) was a prominent citizen of Brooklyn and a well-known publisher. Born in Westminster, VT, Spooner learned the printing trade at an early age from his father and uncle. He completed his apprenticeship under his cousin, Samuel Green, in New London, CT. From 1794 to 1811, Spooner published the 
                <emph render="italic">Suffolk Gazette</emph> in Sag Harbor, Long Island. In 1811 Spooner moved to Brooklyn, where he purchased the 
                <emph render="italic">Long Island Star</emph>, Long Island's oldest newspaper. Under Spooner's leadership, the 
                <emph render="italic">Star</emph> came to yield a significant amount of influence in the local affairs of the Brooklyn community.</p>
            <p>In addition to his work as publisher of the 
                <emph render="italic">Star</emph>, Spooner was also active in the political and social life of Brooklyn. He was surrogate of Kings County from 1841 to 1845, and recording secretary for the Brooklyn Lyceum Board of Directors. Later he rose to Colonel of the 13th Regiment of the New York State Militia and played an active role in the chartering of the Brooklyn Gas Light Company. He was married twice, first to Rebecca Jermain (1786-1824), and then to Mary Ann Wetmore (1794-1877), who was superintendent of a female Sunday school at St. Ann's Church, as well as an author of poetry.</p>
            <p>Edwin B. and Alden Jermain Spooner, two of Alden Spooner's sons with his first wife, are also briefly represented in this collection. Edwin (circa 1807-1876) worked with his father on the 
                <emph render="italic">Long Island Star</emph> and spent most of his life as a publisher in Brooklyn, while Alden Jermain (1810-1881) practiced law in Brooklyn and served for a time as commissioner of jurors. He was also one of the founders of the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) and, as one item in this collection attests, may have been an illustrator.</p>

Alden Spooner's portrait (M1974.110) was painted by Hubbard Lanthan Fordham in 1829, while Mary Ann Spooner's portrait (M1974.113) was done by Fordham in 1833. Edwin B. Spooner's portrait (M1974.119) was painted by Ezra Bisbee in 1844. Descriptions and digital versions of all three portaits are available for searching via the image database in the Othmer Library.</p>
