            <p>Marie Trommer was born in Kremenchoug, Ukraine, on September 29, 1895 and immigrated to the United States with her family in 1905. She graduated from the Women's Art School and Cooper Union Art School in 1914 and established herself as an artist, writer, and critic in New York City. Trommer was an especially prolific writer for the American Jewish press. She was a staff member of the 
                <emph render="italic">Jewish Tribune</emph>, and also contributed to the 
                <emph render="italic">Jewish Daily News</emph> and the 
                <emph render="italic">Boston Jewish Advocate.</emph> She was also the editor and publisher of the bi-monthly 
                <emph render="italic">American Russian Review</emph>, and was known for her translations of Russian nature poems into English, as well as translations of American and British poetry into Russian.</p>
            <p>Marie Trommer's artwork consisted primarily of paintings done in oil and watercolors, and was first exhibited at the Society of Independent Artists in 1924. She exhibited her work frequently over the following 30 years, including exhibitions at the American Museum of Natural History and the Grant Galleries, among others. Marie Trommer was a lifelong resident of Brooklyn following her immigration to the United States, and she died in New York City on February 6, 1971.</p>
