            <p>Martyn Weston (born Martyn Weinstein) was an architect active in Brooklyn from the 1920s through the 1960s. He and Samuel Malkind formed the firm Malkind &amp; Weinstein at 93 Court Street in Downtown Brooklyn around 1927. Weston changed his surname at some time during the World War II era. In the 1940s, his son Donald joined his office, which moved to 44 Court Street and became known as Martyn and Don Weston Architects.</p>
            <p>Weston primarily designed large residential and commercial buildings in Brooklyn and Queens. Two of his synagogues in Brooklyn are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, and the Kingsway Jewish Center in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn. Weston was a charter member and president of the Brooklyn Society of Architects, president of the American Institute for Architects Brooklyn Chapter, and treasurer of the New York State Association of Architects.</p>
