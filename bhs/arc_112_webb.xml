            <abstract id="ref10" label="Abstract">Gregory Burkitt Webb (1878-1948) was an architect who lived in Brooklyn, N.Y. with his wife, Clarine Matson Webb. After spending the early part of his career designing banks, theaters, and hotels in various South American cities, Webb became an established designer of mausoleums and abbeys in and around the New York City area, including Cypress Hills Abbey and Memorial Abbey at Brooklyn's Cypress Hills Cemetery, Ferncliff Mausoleum at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, N.Y., and Holy Cross Cloister at Brooklyn's Cemetery of the Holy Cross. In addition to his professional accomplishments, Webb was also a collector of political cartoons. The Gregory B. Webb collection spans the period 1898 to 1967 and contains materials documenting Webb's architectural career and the various projects on which he worked. These items include blueprints, floor plans, and other technical drawings; photographs and engravings; correspondence; agreements; news clippings; brochures; programs; and advertisements. The collection also contains a substantial assortment of political cartoons portraying, and often criticizing, the Spanish-American War, President Theodore Roosevelt, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal politics. Personal items of Webb's wife, Clarine Matson Webb, and Clarine's friend, the artist Isabel Hawxhurst Hall, are also included in the collection.</abstract>

These items illuminate Clarine's involvement in local social and cultural affairs, with an emphasis on her activities as an alumni representative of the Class of 1900 of Adelphi Academy in Brooklyn, and her involvement in several historical societies and museums, particularly the Long Island Historical Society (later the Brooklyn Historical Society). A photographic portrait of Clarine is also included.</p>
                    <p>The series also includes a diary belonging to Isabel Hawxhurst Hall, an artist specializing in book illustrations, ornamental rugs, and stained glass window designs. While the nature of Hall's relationship to the Webbs is not fully known, the entries and supplemental items contained throughout her diary suggest that she was a personal friend of Clarine's and may have worked with Gregory in a professional capacity. In addition to daily entries, Hall's diary contains stained glass window drawings and designs, correspondence, newspaper clippings, photographs, and programs relating to fine and performing arts, literature, fashion, architecture and interior design, social and cultural life in New York City, and the events of World War II. There are also several postcards that seem to have been collected by Hall while on various vacation trips.</p>

                    <p>This series is comprised of original and photocopied political cartoons collected by Gregory B. Webb, as well as miscellaneous materials such as articles, satiric pieces, and a set of sheet music. Most items have been clipped from newspapers and pasted onto cardboard, often bearing period advertisements on the verso. The subject of Theodore Roosevelt dominates the series, and more often than not his persona, policies, and initiatives (particularly the Spanish-American War) are treated in a sharply satirical or critical light.
