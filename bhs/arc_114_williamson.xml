            <p>This collection, spanning 1687 to 1953, contains 11 items pertaining to the William Williamson family of Gravesend, N.Y. Photostat items include an oath of allegiance to Britain for William Williamson, dated 1687, and military orders, a military appointment, and an oath of allegiance for Rem Williamson, all of which date from the Revolutionary War period. Rem Williamson's military orders were signed by Colonel R. Van Brunt. The remaining portion of the collection consists of loose pages from a family bible listing birth, marriage, and death dates of members of the Williamson family (in particular, descendents of Rem Williamson) which may be of interest to genealogists. The last entry is of Marietta C. Hill, who lived in Windham, N.Y. and was buried in 1953 at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.</p>

            <p>William Williamson (b. 1637) was an early settler of New Netherland, a Dutch colony which covered the region presently known as New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. He emigrated from Holland around 1657 and settled in Gravesend, now a neighborhood in modern-day Brooklyn. Williamson and his wife Mayke Peterse Wyckoff (b. 1653) had seven children, the eldest of whom was Nicholas (b. 1680). Nicholas Williamson had at least 10 children, including son Rem (b. 1738). Rem Williamson served as Captain of the Second Company Foot Militia, township of Gravesend, in the Militia of the Colony of New York during the American Revolutionary War.</p>
