                    <p>This series includes Brooklyn Children's Aid Society (BCAS) annual reports, 1870-1946, two publications titled 
                        <emph render="italic">Summer Relief for Little Children</emph> and 
                        <emph render="italic">Thirty-Five Years of Saving Services</emph>, and three Children's Day registers, 1937-1947.</p>
                    <p>The first register documents children admitted to BCAS, 1939-1944, while the second register continues from 1945 to 1946. The third register appears to document children admitted for the years 1937-1947. All three registers list the name of child admitted; case, city, and state numbers; dates the children were admitted, committed, expiration, and discharged; who the children were committed by (public agency or relatives); date of birth of the child and age of the child when committed; if the children were committed or non-committed to boarding homes, Herriman, or Wavecrest; remarks; and temporary home.</p>

                        <p>This collection contains photographs, albums, glass and film slides, and 35mm and 16mm film. Though many of the photographs were composed shots, the lantern slides show the realities of life in poverty/tenements? Most of the material shows the work of the organization helping individuals with physical disabilities. It also includes images of staff events, such as dinners. The film and glass slides document the poor in a manner similar to Jacob Riis. The film footage mostly shows the blind â€œlearning to deal with the environment." Information in the collection folder also provides some description of particular object numbers and their subjects, such as "work w/blind" and "camp outdoors"</p>
                        <p>Album V1991.110.303 seems to have Brooklyn Week for the Blind as its theme; all the images with this album # were probably taken on or before May of 1950. V1991.110.304 consists of photos removed from between the leaves of a scrapbook, pertaining to the Brooklyn Week for the Blind in 1957, 1958, and 1959. The scrapbook is now under 1991.002 Box 21. V1991.110.301 consists of photos from the 1970s dealing with job training for mentally disabled children at St. Finbar's School. The album is in need of conservation, to remove photos stuck to deteriorating and yellowed adhesive.</p>
