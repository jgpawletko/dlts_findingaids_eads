            <p>The Ocean Avenue Congregational Church was founded in 1903 and located at Ocean Avenue and Avenue I in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Midwood. The church grew out of a Sunday School meeting group organized the previous year to allow Midwood residents to worship without travelling to the nearby neighborhood of Flatbush. Ocean Avenue Congregational Church expanded steadily, with over 700 members by 1935. In 1943, the church absorbed the congregation of the Kings Highway Congregational Church. Despite these growths, the chuch lost a significant number of members during the late 1950s. Committee members voted to sell the church's property, and the congregation joined the Flatbush-Tompkins Congregational Church in early 1961.</p>
