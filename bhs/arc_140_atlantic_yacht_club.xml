            <p>The Atlantic Yacht Club was a sailing social club founded in 1866. Based in Brooklyn, N.Y., the club was formed to support and encourage recreational yachting in the New York Bay. The first club house was located at the foot of Court Street in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Red Hook. The club house moved in 1881, to the foot of 55th Street in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park, and again in 1898 to Sea Gate, at the western end of Coney Island. After a club house fire in 1933, the Atlantic Yacht Club fell into inactivity before being revived in the early 21st century by a new generation of sailing enthusiasts.</p>
