            <p>The Brooklyn League was founded on January 24, 1898 with the mission "to bring together for common action all citizens of the borough of Brooklyn who are interested in its welfare; to co-operate with officials in promoting and forwarding local improvements and in securing efficient and economical administration; to watch the conduct of public business and the course of legislation, both state and municipal; to procure for members timely and accurate information regarding all matters of public concern affecting the borough or any part of it; to support effectively whatever makes for the best interests of the borough or of the city-at-large, and to oppose whatever is hostile thereto." (1)</p>
            <p>Membership to the Brooklyn League was open to any registered voter or taxpayer residing in Brooklyn upon election by the League's Membership Committee, and the payment of annual membership dues. Members of the Brooklyn League served on committees concerned with various civic and social issues in Brooklyn, including Education, Gas and Electricity, Municipal Ordinances, Legislation, Assessment and Taxation, etc. The Brooklyn League's headquarters was located in the Temple Bar Building at 44 Court Street in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>
