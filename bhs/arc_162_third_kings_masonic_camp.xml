            <p>The Third Kings Masonic Camp Fund (later, the Third Kings Masonic Camp and Charities Fund) provided financial support to send under-privileged city children to summer camp. The Fund was established in January 1931 by the Third Kings Masonic District, one of the Brooklyn districts of local Masonic bodies. In its first year, the Fund sent 98 children to summer camp. By its 10th anniversary, the number had grown to 281 children attending summer camp with monies raised by the Fund.</p>
            <p>The inaugural Third Kings Masonic Camp Fund Annual Entertainment and Dance fundraiser was held in 1931. The event included speeches, entertainment, and dancing and for many years was held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Each year, the Fund would publish an event program (sometimes referred to as the Journal) listing officers and members of event committees, donors and advertisers, and all participating Masonic lodges.</p>

            <p>The Third Kings Masonic Camp Fund publications span the years 1937 to 1987 and are housed in one manuscript box. The collection consists of 16 event programs issued by the Fund for the annual fundraising eventâ€”Third Kings Masonic Camp Fund Annual Entertainment and Dance. The following years are represented in the collection: 1937 to 1941, 1943, 1946 to 1949, 1954, 1963, 1964, 1971, 1974, and 1987. Although the content included in the programs varied over the years, generally they contained lists of members of the various committees for the event; lists of supporters and donors; lists of the participating Masonic Lodges and the corresponding membership lists of those lodges; and advertisements for local businesses.</p>
