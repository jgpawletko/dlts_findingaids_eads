            <p>The Central Brooklyn Coordinating Council (CBCC) was established in 1957 for the improvement of the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The CBCC focused on urban renewal projects, education and skills training, drug addiction treatment programs, employment workshops, mental health programs, cultural programs, police-community relations, youth services, and housing redevelopment among other issues. The CBCC advocated for community reform, renewal, and redevelopment in various ways including broadcasting public affairs radio programs on WWRL; publishing community newsletters such as
