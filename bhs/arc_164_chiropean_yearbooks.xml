            <p>The Chiropean was a Brooklyn-based club for women whose purpose was to "bring together women with the view of making them helpful to each other and useful to society." The club was apolitical but was Christian in association.</p>
            <p>The Chiropean was organized and incorporated in 1896. Club meetings were held on the first and third Thursdays of each month, except during June, July, August, and September. The club's first meeting was held on February 13, 1896 in what was then called the Eastern District of Brooklyn. The name Chiropean was an acronym, with each letter representing a quality or object meant to inspire members: C for christianity, charity, and chastity; H for hope, health, and happiness; I for integrity, industry, and independence; R for resolution, resistance, and reserve; O for onward, obedience, and opportunity; P for patriotism, politeness, and punctuality; E for energy, earnestness, and experience; A for ambition, amiability, and art; and N for nearness, neighborliness, and newness.</p>
