            <p>The Brooklyn Art Club was an art society for professional artists. Organized in 1878 and incorporated in 1890, the Brooklyn Art Club held annual exhibitions for both the exhibition and sale of art work created by Club members. Membership was open to both men and women. The exhibitions were held at Sherk's Galleries located at 435 Fulton Street, in what is now the neighborhood of Downtown Brooklyn, and later at the Art Association Galleries on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights.</p>

            <p>The Brooklyn Art Club annual exhibition catalogs span the years 1882 to 1898 and are housed in one half manuscript box. The collection consists of both originals and photocopies of annual exhibition catalogs of the Brooklyn Art Club.</p>
            <p>The exhibition catalogs include the names of Club officers and committee members; names and studio addresses of Club members; and the catalog of art to be exhibited or auctioned. The catalog of art lists the title of the work of art, the starting price for the work of art (frame included), and the name of the artist for each work of art. The catalogs also contain advertisements, most comprising of art related businesses and services located in Brooklyn and Manhattan.</p>
            <p>For the years 1886 and 1887, exhibitions were held twice a yearâ€” in spring and autumn. Beginning in 1887, exhibitions were held once annually and the catalogs began to include illustrations.</p>
