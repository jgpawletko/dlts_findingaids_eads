            <p>The Early Brooklyn libraries collection spans the years 1865 to 1901 and measures 0.3 linear feet. The collection is comprised of materials that document the development and operation of independently-operated public libraries in Brooklyn prior to the establishment of the Brooklyn Public Library System in 1892. The bulk of materials in the collection pertain to the Mercantile Library of Brooklyn, which include detailed catalogs of materials in the library and bulletins announcing new book acquisitions. Also included are the constitution and first annual report of the Brooklyn Library Association of the Eastern District; newsletters of the Pratt Institute Free Library, the Bay Ridge Free Library, and the Long Island Free Library; the constitution and by-laws of the Law Library in Brooklyn; articles of association, subscription lists, and publications of the Brooklyn Athanaeum and Reading Room; and a catalog of the Library of Schools in the Eastern District.</p>

            <head>Historical note</head>
            <p>Prior to the establishment of the Brooklyn Public Library by an Act of Legislature of the State of New York in 1892, Brooklyn was served by a number of independently operated libraries that were open to the public, but which in many cases required a membership fee to use. In 1857, the Mercantile Library Association of the City of Brooklyn was established, and the Mercantile Library of Brooklyn subsequently opened in a building shared by the Brooklyn Athanaeum and Reading Room. In 1865, the Brooklyn Library Association of the Eastern District was established for the purpose of establishing a library in Brooklyn's Eastern District, and in 1868, the Law Library in Brooklyn was established.</p>
            <p>In 1888, the Pratt Institute established the first free public library in Brooklyn. This was followed by the opening of several more free public libraries, including the Bay Ridge Free Library and the Long Island Free Library on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. Following the New York State Assembly's approval of the establishment of the Brooklyn Public Library, the Brooklyn Common Council passed a resolution approving its establishment in 1896, and the development of the library system continued throughout the 20th century with the help of a $1.6 million donation from Andrew Carnegie to build 21 branch locations.</p>
