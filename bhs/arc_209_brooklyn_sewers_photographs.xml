            <p>The Brooklyn sewers construction photograph collection, dating from 1903 to 1917 with bulk dates of 1903 to 1905, consists of 59 black-and-white glass plate negatives and one photograph album. The collection documents sewer construction in Brooklyn and includes images of work crews, surveying crews, construction supervisors, and engineers, as well as views of street excavation and bracing, machinery used during construction, and street scenes in Brooklyn, among other subjects. The photographers are unknown.</p>
            <p>Some of the images from the glass plate negatives are also included in the photograph album. Notes in the photograph album, when included, identify the people, location, and machinery in the photographs. They also help to identify people and locations in some of the glass plate negatives.</p>

            <p>In the mid-19th century, the City of Brooklyn made a serious effort to tackle its sewage and waste problems. As with the rest of the United States, Brooklyn (as did Manhattan) lacked underground sewage systems. With the outbreak of cholera and other infectious diseases circa 1830, combined with an ever-rising population, the City of Brooklyn established a Board of Sewer Commissioners in 1857 to deal with its formidable sewage disposal problems. Still, sewage disposal consisted mostly of drainage, and it wasn't until the last quarter of the 19th century that the construction of underground sewage systems began in Brooklyn.</p>
