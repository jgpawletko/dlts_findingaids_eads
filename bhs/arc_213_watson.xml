                    <p>This series consists of 98 black-and-white photographs taken by Edward B. Watson between 1927 and 1957. The photographs, all black-and-white photographic prints, were taken in various locations in Brooklyn and primarily document buildings with turrets. It is unclear if the photographer also intended to capture lamp posts, street car cables, and street car rails, but they are also represented in the photographs.</p>

                    <p>This series consists of roughly 440 prints culled from primarily architectural magazines by Edward B. Watson. The magazines from which the prints came were published circa 1880 to 1935. While the majority of the prints are black-and-white, there are several in color. The subjects are chiefly buildings, structures, and monuments located in Brooklyn. Images of Prospect Park and Coney Island are also well-represented in the series. The series includes interior, exterior, and detail views of buildings, as well as street views of Brooklyn and beach views of Coney Island and Manhattan Beach, among others. The prints often include information regarding the architect and the architectural design of each individual building. Building types include, but are not limited to, commercial buildings, schools, communication buildings, societies' buildings, religious buildings, municipal buildings, fraternal buildings, military buildings, dwellings, theaters, and banks.</p>
