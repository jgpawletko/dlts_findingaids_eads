            <p>This collection includes materials dating from 1863 to 1957 documenting the peacetime activities of the NGSNY 23rd (later 106th) Infantry Regiment, as well as the Regiment's service in the Civil War and World War I. Items include muster rolls and member lists, dinner and event programs and invitations, regimental histories, news clippings, photographs, and issues of the Regiment's journals, 
                <emph render="italic">The Guardsman</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Vigilantia</emph>. Also included are two scrapbooks of decorations, notes and correspondence, photographs, clippings, and ephemera. One scrapbook commemorates a rifle match between the NGSNY 23rd Regiment and the 13th Regiment of the Pennsylvania National Guard at Gettysburg in 1893, while the other relates to the 23rd Regiment's visit to Gettysburg in 1904. The latter scrapbook is oversized and is housed separately from the rest of the collection. Finally, the collection contains a small number of items documenting the Veteran Association of the 23rd Regiment's Company A, including a dinner and meeting announcement and a single volume containing the Association's constitution, amendments, and membership lists with autograph signatures and addresses for each member.</p>

            <p>The Brooklyn-based 23rd Infantry Regiment of the New York State National Guard (NYSNG) was formed on January 20th, 1862, when its first company, Company A, was mustered into State service. Nine more companies were organized by July of that year. The Regiment was mustered into United States service for the Civil War on June 16, 1863, and participated in engagements at Oyster Point and Carlisle, PA before being mustered out on July 22, 1863. The Regiment was later renamed the NYSNG 106th Infantry Regiment for service in World War I, for which it shipped to Europe in May of 1918 and participated in the Ypres-Lys and Somme Offensives, which were both successful in removing or breaking German defensive lines. The Regiment later went on to supply officers and soldiers throughout the world during World War II.</p>
