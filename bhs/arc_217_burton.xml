            <p>The Burton family papers and photographs date from 1870 to 1949 and measure 1.25 linear feet. The collection includes the papers of William W. Burton, his wife Virginia Baptista Burton, their son and daughter-in-law Percival Burton and Josie E. Newcombe Burton, and the Newcombe family. Manuscript material includes bonds, deeds, titles, and mortgages related to the family home on Lafayette Avenue; wills; family correspondence; school ephemera and certificates; receipts and account books; and drivers licenses and automobile registration papers.</p>
            <p>Photographs in the collection, totalling 189 items, include cabinet cards, cartes-de-visite, tintypes, and prints with portraits of the Burton family. Many of the photographic items are contained in two albums. Portraits of unidentified men, women, and children--possibly related to the Burton and Newcombe families--as well as images of Naval ships, Manhattan, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are also included.</p>

            <head>Biographical note</head>
            <p>William W. Burton (d. 1882) was born in England and became a U.S. citizen in 1861. The same year, he married Virginia Baptista, a Portugese immigrant. William Burton was a house painter based in Manhattan. The Burton family lived at 436 Lafayette Avenue in what is now the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The couple had five children: Percival, Virginia E., Minnie, Charles, and Sidney. Percival Burton (b. 1879) married Josie E. Newcombe, and the couple had one son, Robert Burton.</p>
            <p>Virginia Baptista was born in Madeira, Portugal, and was separated from her family as they emigrated from Portugal to Trinidad. According to correspondence, she was stolen by a childless couple who eventually settled in New York. Twenty-five years later, Baptista was able to locate her family in Madeira, but lost permanent contact with her mother. Her father died two months after his family left Portugal.</p>
