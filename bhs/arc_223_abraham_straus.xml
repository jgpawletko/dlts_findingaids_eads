            <p>Abraham &amp; Straus was a major department store founded in Brooklyn by Abraham Abraham and Joseph Wechsler in 1865. Originally called Wechsler &amp; Abraham and located at 285 Fulton Street, the store was so successful that it moved to a new and larger location at the corner of Fulton and Hoyt Streets in 1885. The name of the store changed to Abraham &amp; Straus in 1893 when the Straus family, partners of Macy's department stores, bought out Wechsler's interest in the store. By 1965, Abraham &amp; Straus had become the third largest department store in the United States, with several branches in and surrounding the New York City area in addition to its flagship location at Fulton and Hoyt Streets. The store became part of Macy's department stores in 1995. As of 2011, the original Abraham &amp; Straus location on Fulton and Hoyt Streets continues to operate under the Macy's name.</p>

            <p>This collection includes various materials relating to Abraham &amp; Straus throughout the period 1865 to 1995. The majority of the items date from 1964 and 1965 and were compiled by Abraham &amp; Straus employee Juli Daves in preparation for the store's centennial celebration. These items include newsletters, a history of Abraham &amp; Straus, news clippings, and correspondence between Juli Daves and Mrs. Kenn Stryker-Rodda, Archivist at the Long Island Historical Society (later the Brooklyn Historical Society), regarding research for the centennial. Other materials in the collection include store directories, souvenir shopping bags, employee newsletters, various printed ephemera, and a catalog dating from 1886, when the store was known as Wechsler &amp; Abraham. A small number of photographs are also included and depict Abraham &amp; Straus founder Abraham Abraham; Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Sidney L. Solomon; President Walter N. Rothschild, Jr.; and the Wechsler &amp; Abraham store at its original Fulton Street location. The photographs have biographical and historical information attached to their versos. There is also an oversize print showing an aerial view of the flagship Abraham &amp; Straus store at its location on Fulton and Hoyt Streets, along with other parts of Downtown Brooklyn, circa 1893. This print is housed separately in an oversize box.</p>
