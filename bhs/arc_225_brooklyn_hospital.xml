            <p>The Brooklyn Hospital was incorporated as the Brooklyn City Hospital by the New York State Legislature in 1845, and was renamed the Brooklyn Hospital in 1883. The Hospital's first building was constructed on an area bounded by Canton Street, DeKalb Avenue, and Raymond Street and opened in 1852. As the Hospital grew throughout the ensuing decades, its original building expanded into a sprawling complex of medical facilities. In 1880, the Hospital established Brooklyn's first nurse training school, which came to be known as the Brooklyn Training School for Nurses. In 1982, the Brooklyn Hospital merged with the Caledonian Hospital and was renamed the Brooklyn Hospital-Caledonian Hospital. This name was later changed to the Brooklyn Hospital Center in 1990, and as of 2011 the Hospital continues to operate under this most recent name.</p>

            <p>The Brooklyn Hospital records document the Hospital's administration and operations throughout the period circa 1845, when the Hospital was named the Brooklyn City Hospital, to 1991, when the Hospital's name had changed to the Brooklyn Hospital-Caledonian Hospital. Though the materials in the collection reflect the Hospital's various name changes in the 19th and 20th centuries, most items date from the period when the Hospital was consistently known as the Brooklyn Hospital. The majority of the collection consists of the Hospital's annual reports, as well as annual reports of the Brooklyn Training School for Nurses. Additional items include various progress reports, newsletters, brochures, calendars, periodicals, and a subscription book dating from the founding of the Hospital.</p>
