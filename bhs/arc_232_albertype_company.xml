            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>The Albertype Company viewbooks of New York City consist of three viewbooks published by the Albertype Company, from 1902 to 1939. The majority of the images from the viewbooks are views of New York City, though several images relating to Brooklyn are included. All three viewbooks contain black-and-white non-photographic prints of photographs (and a few renderings) and retain their original softcovers. The first viewbook, 
                <emph render="italic">New York</emph>, consists of 24 pages, with page size measuring 9 x 11, and was published in 1902. The photographs are attributed to A. Wittemann. The second viewbook, also titled 
                <emph render="italic">New York</emph>, was published circa 1930 and consists of 24 pages, measuring 10 x 12.5. The third viewbook, 
                <emph render="italic">The City of New York</emph>, is a Series L.C. 1938-1939 Edition, and consists of 47 pages, measuring 10 x 13. The photographs are attributed to H. L. Wittemann. The viewbooks show images of many iconic buildings in Manhattan, most of which are still standing, as well as aerial views of Manhattan, and cityscapes of Manhattan from the vantage point of Brooklyn, among others.</p>
