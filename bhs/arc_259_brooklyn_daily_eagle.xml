            <p>This collection contains copies of three different 
                <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</emph> centennial numbers, which were published on April 8, 1934 to commemorate the centennial anniversary of Brooklyn's chartering as a city. The issues contain historical information on the city of Brooklyn as it was in 1834 and illustrate the city's development over the subsequent century, in which it had transitioned into a borough of New York City. Also included is one educational supplement from a 1905 issue of the 
                <emph render="italic">Eagle</emph>.</p>

            <p>Brooklyn was officially established in 1646 by Dutch settlers, and was one of the six original towns comprising the present-day borough of Brooklyn, the others being Bushwick, Flatbush, Flatlands, Gravesend, and New Utrecht. The six towns were later placed under the administrative jurisdiction of Kings County by the English, who in 1664 supplanted the Dutch as the dominant colonial power in the region. In 1816, the town of Brooklyn was incorporated as the Village of Brooklyn, and in 1834 it was chartered as the City of Brooklyn. Over the next several decades, the expanding city annexed the other five original towns of Kings County. In 1898, the City of Brooklyn became a borough of the newly-consolidated New York City.</p>
            <p>The 
                <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</emph> was a daily newspaper that was published in Brooklyn for over 114 years. Founded in 1841 by Isaac van Anden and Henry Cruse Murphy, the newspaper had become one of the most widely read papers in the United States by the 1860s.</p>
