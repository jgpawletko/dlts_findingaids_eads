            <p>Independence Community Bank was founded in Brooklyn, N.Y. in 1850 and was originally named The South Brooklyn Savings Institution. It was bought out by Sovereign Bank in 2006. After the buyout, the Brooklyn Historical Society, with the support of the Independence Community Foundation (now the Brooklyn Community Foundation), conducted 16 extended interviews with past and present employees of Independence Community Bank to document the end of the Bank's 155 years based in Brooklyn.</p>
