            <p>Samuel John Atlee's journal on the Battle of Long Island consists of a single bound volume containing one full handwritten journal entry by Atlee and a handwritten excerpt from the same entry, both dated August 27, 1776. The journal provides Atlee's first-hand account of his defense of the Old Stone House in Brooklyn during the Battle of Long Island, as well as his capture by the British Army on the same day. Both the full journal entry and the excerpt are recorded in different handwriting and on different paper, and it is not clear whether either one was recorded by Atlee himself.</p>

            <head>Biographical note</head>
            <p>Samuel John Atlee (1739-1786) was born in Trenton, New Jersey and spent most of his childhood in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Atlee's military career began during the French and Indian War when he was placed in command of a company of the provincial service from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. On March 21, 1776 Atlee was promoted to the rank of Colonel of the Pennsylvania Musketry Battalion of the Continental Army, which was dispatched to defend New York City during the Battle of Long Island. Colonel Atlee's battalion led the original defense of the Old Stone House in Brooklyn and was captured by the British Army on August 27, 1776. Colonel Atlee was held as a prisoner of war until he was released in a prisoner exchange on October 1, 1778.</p>
            <p>Following his incarceration, the Pennsylvania Assembly named Atlee as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He held this position until 1782, when he returned to Lancaster County and was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly. Atlee served as an Assembly member until his death in 1786.</p>
