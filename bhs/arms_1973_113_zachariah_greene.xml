            <p>Zachariah Greene (1760-1858) was a Presbyterian minister who served congregations in North Stamford, CT, as well as the towns of Cutchogue and Setauket in Long Island. After serving on the American side during the Revolutionary War, from which he was discharged after being wounded, Greene attended Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. He was ordained by the Presbyterian Church after completing his studies.</p>

            <p>This collection consists of one ledger kept by Zachariah Greene during the period 1787 to 1848, in which he recorded the marriages he performed as a minister at Presbyterian churches in the Long Island towns of Cutchogue and Setauket. For each marriage he performed, Greene recorded the marriage date, names of the individuals married, and their towns of residence. The ledger also records the deaths of parishioners at Greene's congregations in Cutchogue and Setauket, as well as his earlier congregation at North Stamford, CT. For each deceased parishioner, Greene noted the date of death, known family relations, and approximate age at the time of death. The ledger is accompanied by an index created in 1934 by Edna Huntington, Librarian at the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society). The collection also includes a 1921 program for the service commemorating the reopening of the Setauket Presbyterian Church.</p>
