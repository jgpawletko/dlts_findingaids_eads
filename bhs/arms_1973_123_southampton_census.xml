            <p>The Southampton census of 1821 consists of a single bound, handwritten volume. It lists the first and last names of the primary member of each household in the town, accompanied by numerical figures written in 11 separate columns next to each name. The first four columns list figures pertaining to the number of freeholders residing in each household, and the number of acres of improved land occupied by each household. Information explaining the meaning of the numerals in the other seven columns is missing. Recorded in the back of the volume is summary information listing the total number of freeholders and non-freeholders living in Southampton; the total acreage of occupied improved land; the total number of cattle, sheep, and horses owned by town residents; the total quantity (in yards) of flannel, linen and woolen cloths produced in Southampton; and the total number of grist mills, fulling mills, saw mills, carding machines and cotton and woolen factories in operation at the time the census was recorded.</p>
