            <p>The 19th Ward Republican Party campaign club records are housed in a single volume and span the period 1868 to 1872. Represented in the collection are three Republican Party campaign clubs organized by voters in Brooklyn's 19th Ward during the US presidential election of 1868, the New York State gubernatorial election of 1870, and the US presidential election of 1872. The Grant and Colfax Club records, dated 1868, include the club's by-laws, the names and addresses of its members, and meeting minutes. The meeting minutes document the club's campaign activities, votes taken by the club's executive committee, and list expenses incurred throughout the campaign. The Woodford and Kaufman Campaign Club records, dated 1870, include the club's by-laws, and list the names and addresses of its members. The Grant and Wilson Campaign Club records, dated 1872, include the club's by-laws, a list of club officers and committees, and a membership list, including each member's name and address.</p>

            <p>During the US presidential elections of 1868 and 1872, and the New York State gubernatorial election of 1870, campaign clubs were formed by the Republican Party in the city of Brooklyn, New York, both at the city level and at the voting ward level. The purpose of these clubs was to officially endorse the Party's nominees for office and campaign on their behalf during election season, as well as to turn out the vote in their respective wards on election day. In 1868, ward-level campaign clubs were organized in the city of Brooklyn on behalf of Republican presidential and vice-presidential nominees Ulysses S. Grant and Schuyler Colfax; in 1870 they were organized on behalf of Republican gubernatorial nominee Stewart L. Woodward and his running mate Sigismund Kaufman; and in 1872, ward-level campaign clubs were organized on behalf of incumbent Republican presidential nominee Ulysses S. Grant and his running mate, Henry Wilson.</p>
