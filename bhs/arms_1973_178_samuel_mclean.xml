            <p>Samuel McLean (1820-1893) was a Brooklyn merchant who worked in the dry goods trade with the firm William Turnbull &amp; Co. He later went into partnership with Frank Woodruff in the storage warehouse business. McLean was an active member of the Hamilton Literary Association, a Brooklyn debating society, and was the first president of the Hamilton Club, a social club that later absorbed the Hamilton Literary Association. McLean was also active in the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) and was a member of Brooklyn's Grace Church.</p>

            <p>This collection contains a small assortment of speeches written and delivered by Samuel McLean throughout the period 1866 to 1885. The majority of the speeches were given by McLean at the Hamilton Literary Association and the Hamilton Club, though an 1867 speech was given to commemorate the opening of Brooklyn's Mercantile Library. Both the original handwritten speeches, as well as typed transcripts, are included.</p>
