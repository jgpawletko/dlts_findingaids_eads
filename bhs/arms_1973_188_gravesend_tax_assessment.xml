            <p>One tax assessment book containing an alphabetical list of residents of the Town of Gravesend in Brooklyn, circa 1880, with assessments of each resident's property. For each resident, the book notes the property location, number of acres assessed, building value, real estate value, personal estate value, aggregate value, and amount taxed.

An assessment list of non-residents is also included. The compiler of the assessment book is unknown.</p>

Gravesend was annexed by the City of Brooklyn in 1894.</p>
