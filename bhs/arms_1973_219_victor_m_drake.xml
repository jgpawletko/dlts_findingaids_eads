            <p>The Victor M. Drake papers on the U.S.S. Monitor consist of several documents, primarily concerning the 
                <emph render="italic">Monitor</emph>'s crew. Included are both typewritten and handwritten notes on the ship's crew members, featuring first and last names, ranks, and in some instanceas, birth and death dates. These lists also identify crew members who were residents of Brooklyn. Also included are two newspaper clippings; one dates from 1953 and discusses the history of the Battle of Hampton Roads, and the other dates from circa 1861 and announces the commissioning of the 
                <emph render="italic">Monitor</emph> by the United States Navy. The papers were created and compiled by Drake during the 1950s.</p>
