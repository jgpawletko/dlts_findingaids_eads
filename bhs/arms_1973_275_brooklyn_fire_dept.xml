            <p>The first record of organized firefighting in the town of Brooklyn, one of the six original towns comprising the present-day borough of Brooklyn, dates from 1772. An official Fire Department, consisting solely of volunteers, was established in 1785. By 1816, when Brooklyn was formally incorporated as a village, the Village of Brooklyn Fire Department had a total roll of 95 volunteer firefighters. In 1869, the then-City of Brooklyn's first paid professional Fire Department went into operation.</p>
