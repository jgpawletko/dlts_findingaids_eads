            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">The Seaman family papers (1752-1838) principally concern merchant John Seaman and Willet Seaman, though several other Seaman family members are also represented. The bulk of the collection consists of deeds and other documents concerning land transactions. Several of these deeds relate to land in North Hempstead, Long Island, acquired to establish a manufactory for woolen goods, circa 1816. Other legal documents related to this business are also in the collection, such as partnership agreements and an insurance policy. An indenture for an apprentice from the Overseers of the Poor of Brooklyn and a bill of sale for John Seaman's purchase of an enslaved African-American also relate to the manufactory, known as Seaman and Cock (the Cock referring to partners John Cock and Townsend Cock). Other land transactions concern Seaman properties or interests on Long Island, New York City, other New York State counties, and other states. Other documents include John Seaman's will, Seaman's conditions for the eventual manumission of the slave he purchased, and correspondence from Willet Seaman supporting quarantine laws to prevent the spread of yellow fever.</abstract>

            <p>The collection is organized with deeds and other land documents first, followed by correspondence and other document foms.</p>
            <p>The collection is no longer in its original order as presented by the donor to the Long Island Historical Society (now Brooklyn Historical Society). The material was originally presented in two "bundles" with documents numbered from 1 to 43. An inventory supplied by the donor listed the items and their relationship. Likely in the mid 2000s, the documents were re-arranged from their sequential order to the present arrangement. Nonetheless, the original sequential numbers are still noted on the documents themselves, on the folder labels, and in the container list. A copy of the original inventory is with the collection.</p>

            <p>There are many branches of the Seaman family on Long Island and in the New York area extending back to the 1600s. One of the principal Seamans in this collection is a John Seaman, but it is not immediately clear which of many John Seamans this is. Other Seamans in the collection also have names in common with other Seamans. The researcher is directed to Brooklyn Historical Society's catalog, Bobcat, to identify genealogical works that might help in this regard. The collection itself was donated by the heirs of Mary Jackson Seaman Albert. According to the note accompanying the collection, Mary Albert was born in Brooklyn on January 8, 1815. She was the daughter of John Seaman and Mary M. Hicks, both of Brooklyn, at least later in their lives. The papers in the collection indicate that John was a merchant in New York City at least until about 1815.</p>

                    <p>The folder includes a bill of sale for Robert, an enslaved African-American. In a separate document, the purchaser, John Seaman of New York, agrees to manumit Robert in eight years, but sets out conditions that Robert must observe or else his term of enslavement will be extended. Robert did not sign the document, but it indicates that he has the original.</p>
