            <p>The Brooklyn Elevated Railroad Company was incorporated in 1874 and became an extensive elevated railroad in Brooklyn and, after the consolidation of 1898, New York City. The first rail was laid in 1883, and the railroad opened to the public in May of 1885. W. Fontaine Bruff was president of the company until circa 1883, when Henry W. Putnam became president. Putnam was succeeded by Adolf Ladenburg in 1892.</p>
            <p>The original elevated line ran from Washington and York streets along Flushing Avenue to Grand Avenue and then Myrtle Avenue. It was taken out of service in 1889 and replaced by 1890 with four main lines:</p>
