            <p>Archaeological evidence testifies that American Indians have been living in the region now comprising the five boroughs of New York City for at least 11,500 years. After European contact in the 16th and 17th centuries, Indians living along the Atlantic seaboard between the Delaware and Hudson valleys became generally known as Delawares, though the Indians referred to themselves as 
                <emph render="italic">Lenape</emph> (people). Indians of the region are believed to have spoken a variant of Delaware dialect known as Munsee. Documented Munsee communities who lived in the area that would eventually become known as Brooklyn included the Marechkawick (sandy place) near present-day Borough Hall, Nayack (point of land), Wichquawanck (sandy bank) at present-day Fort Hamilton, Techkonis (translation unknown) in present-day Gravesend, and Canarsie (grassy place) in present-day Flatlands.</p>

            <p>This collection includes several drafts of a typescript on the history of the American Indian communities who for centuries resided in the region that would eventually become known as Brooklyn, N.Y. after European settlement in the early 17th century. The typescript was compiled by William Christie MacLeod in 1939 and 1940 and was based on research conducted as part of the New York City WPA Historical Records Survey. Additional materials compiled in the research process, such as notes, memos, clippings, transcriptions of documents, and maps, are also included.</p>
