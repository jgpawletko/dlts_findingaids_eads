            <p>Andrew J. Provost (1834-1925) was born in New York City but lived all but his earliest years in Bushwick, Brooklyn and Queens County (N.Y.). His ancestors, which included the Provost and Praa families, had roots in Bushwick (including the Greenpoint area of Bushwick) dating to the 1600s. Provost was an attorney and held various public offices in Kings and Queens counties. The collection, though, centers on Provost's interest as a historian and genealogist. In that capacity, in 1895, Prevost published 
                <emph render="italic">Biographical and Genealogical Notes of the Provost Family from 1545 to 1895</emph>.</p>
            <p>Provost's son, Andrew J. Provost, Jr. (1867-circa 1960), was a civil engineer. He also had an interest in history and genealogy. He was the author of several family histories, including books on the Calyer, Titus and Hendrickson families. A unifying theme of his writings, other than their connection to the Provost family, was the connection to Bushwick, a town until it became part of the city of Brooklyn in the mid-nineteenth century (Brooklyn itself becoming consolidated into New York City in 1898). Provost, Jr.'s interest in Bushwick and its families culminated in his 3 volume
                <emph render="italic"> Early Settlers of Bushwick, Long Island, New York, and Their Descendants</emph>.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>The Andrew J. Provost collection of Bushwick, N.Y., family papers includes documents compiled by Provost likely in connection, at least in part, with his writing of 
                <emph render="italic">Biographical and Genealogical Notes of the Provost Family from 1545 to 1895</emph>. These documents were likely also referred to by Provost's son, the donor of the collection, for his writings in family history. The documents include deeds, indentures, and wills ranging from 1653 to 1835, some with certifications and other official notations ranging to 1859. The earliest original document is 1709; documents dated from the 1600s are nineteenth century certified copies. The materials concern Bushwick (Kings County, N.Y.) families and property, including that in the Greenpoint section. There are a small number of manuscript property maps in the collection, including one showing the Bushwick land inherited by the four daughters of Peter and Maria (nee Hay) Praa. Surnames other than Praa and Provost appearing in the collection include Arundius, Bennet, Calyer, Cappoens, Meserole/Miserol, and Volckertsen, among others.</p>

            <head>Separated Materials note</head>
            <p>The item level inventory dating from the original accession of 1948 indicates that the collection held three maps. At some point these were separated from the collection. During processing in 2012 an attempt was made to find the three maps. Three maps found in Brooklyn Historical Society's Map Collection conformed to the description in the inventory and were returned to the Provost papers.</p>
