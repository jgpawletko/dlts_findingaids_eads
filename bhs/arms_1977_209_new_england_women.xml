            <p>The Brooklyn Society of New England Women, a local chapter of the National Society of New England Women, was organized in March of 1905. According to its constitution, the chapter was founded to "form a bond of sympathy between all women of New England birth or ancestry in this community; to uphold the ideals of the New England character and to instill into the younger generation a love for the traditions of New England and a proper pride in its history." The Society's regular meetings included a mix of musical performances and lectures on historical, sociological, and philanthropic topics.</p>
