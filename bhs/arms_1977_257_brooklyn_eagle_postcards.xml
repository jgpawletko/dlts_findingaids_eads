            <p>The 
                <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph> was a daily newspaper that was published in Brooklyn for over 114 years. Founded in 1841 by Isaac van Anden and Henry Cruse Murphy, the newspaper was originally named the 
                <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle and King's County Democrat</emph>. In 1850, the name was changed to the 
                <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</emph>. By the early 1860s, the newspaper had become one of the most widely read papers in the United States. In 1938, the newspaper underwent another name change when it became the 
                <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph>. Frank D. Schroth bought the paper in 1940 and continued to publish it until 1955 when the 
                <emph render="italic">Eagle </emph>ceased publication during a lengthy strike by the New York Newspaper Guild. Between 1960 and 1963, the 
                <emph render="italic">Eagle </emph>once again resumed publication, this time as a weekly paper (though for a short time as a daily). The run was short-lived and the 
                <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph> office closed in December 1963. In 1996, J. Dozier Hasty, the owner and publisher of Brooklyn Heights Press, purchased the Eagle's name and logo and began to publish the 
                <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle &amp; Daily Bulletin</emph>. As of 2011, the 
                <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle &amp; Daily Bulletin</emph> remains a daily newspaper, published five days per week.</p>
