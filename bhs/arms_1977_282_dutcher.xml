            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Silas Belden Dutcher (1829-1909) was born in Springfield, N.Y., as the second child of Parcefor and Johannah Low Frink Dutcher. In his early years, Dutcher worked on the family farm and taught school. In 1855, Dutcher moved to New York City and began his mercantile career. He continued to work in trade until 1868, when he was compelled to focus exclusively on his rising political career.</p>
            <p>Dutcher's political career had begun in 1856, when he joined the newly-formed Republican Party. He served his first position in public office as Supervisor of the City of New York from 1860 to 1861. In 1868, Dutcher became Supervisor of the Internal Revenue, a position in which he served for four years before being appointed U.S. Pension Agent for the Eastern District of New York by President Ulysses S. Grant. In 1877, Grant appointed Dutcher to the position of Appraiser of the Port of New York, and after serving in this position for three years, Dutcher was made State Supervisor of Public Works by New York Governor Alonzo B. Cornell.</p>
            <p>Dutcher also participated on various political committees. He was chairman of the Kings County Republican Committee for four years, a member of the State Republican Committee, and chairman of the Executive Committee in 1876. In 1896, New York Governor Levi P. Morton appointed him to the commission to frame the charter for Greater New York. Dutcher was also a frequent delegate to Republican state and national conventions.</p>
            <p>Beyond his political activities, Dutcher maintained his business ties throughout most of his life. From 1877 on, he was the director of Metropolitan Life Insurance. He was a charter trustee of Union Dime between 1859 and 1902, and president of the company from 1885 to 1902. In 1891, he became president of the Hamilton Trust Company.</p>
            <p>Beside his active political and business careers, Dutcher was also deeply involved in his family and religious lives. In 1859, he married Rebecca Jacobs Alwaise. Together they lived in Brooklyn and had 8 children over the next 20 years: Dewit Parcefor, Edith, Malcolm, Elsie, Myra, Jessie, and twins Eva and Edna. Dutcher was an involved member of the Dutch Reformed Church, teaching Sunday school and serving as super of the Twelfth Street Reformed Church in Brooklyn for 10 years. He was also a member of the Masonic Fraternity.</p>

                    <p>This series chiefly contains correspondence comprised of loose letters, letter books, and letter copy books. The correspondence spans the entire period covered by the series, and involves Dutcher in his numerous political and business capacities, including Supervisor of the Internal Revenue, Pension Agent for the Eastern District of New York, Appraiser of the Port of New York, New York State Supervisor of Public Works, Director of Metropolitan Life Insurance, President of Union Dime, and President of the Hamilton Trust Company. Additional letters illuminate Dutcher's active role in the Republican Party and his involvement in numerous state and local professional, political, and civic member organizations. The series also includes documents and reports related to certain issues overseen by Dutcher as Supervisor of Public Works, including a legal dispute between the West Shore &amp; Buffalo Railroad Company and the Oxford Copper and Sulphur Company, in which Dutcher was arbitrator, and an application from the West Shore &amp; Buffalo Railroad Company to construct its road over canal lands in Montgomery County. Additional items include financial records, and handwritten and typed transcripts of speeches delivered or received by Dutcher at various events hosted by professional, political, and civic organizations.</p>

                    <p>This series contains a small amount of correspondence relating to certain members of the Dutcher family, and materials relating to Silas B. Dutcher's death in 1909. The correspondence mostly concerns Dutcher's daughter, Edith, and the prospect of her taking a clerical position in the United States Pension Office, an arrangement made possible by her father. Edith ultimately rejects the offer, owing to family committments at home, but recommends a cousin for the position. The remainder of the correspondence is between Dutcher's widow, Rebecca, and the National Memorial, in which the Memorial requests to receive a photograph of the recently-deceased Dutcher. Additional items relating to Dutcher's death include condolences sent to the Dutcher family from the State of New York, the Hamilton Trust Company, and other organizations and personal friends; and photocopies of obituaries of Dutcher clipped from various newspapers. Finally, the series also includes a typed biography and genealogy of Dutcher, the author of which is unknown.</p>

                    <p>This series contains loose newspaper clippings compiled by Silas B. Dutcher and his family throughout the period 1853 to 1909 and relating to a wide range of political and social issues. Certain clippings have been filed together according to their predominant subject matter. These clippings cover such topics as Dutcher's work as Supervisor of Public Works, particularly in regard to the management of New York's canals; Dutcher's private and family lives; trade laws; the New York Customs House; the death of New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley; and the financial scandal involving Tammany Hall's William "Boss" Tweed, among others. All remaining clippings have been grouped together as either miscellaneous or general political clippings. There is also one page clipped from an 1862 French-language newspaper, the contents of which seem to relate to certain events of the American Civil War.</p>
                    <p>The series also contains several pieces of ephemera relating to Dutcher's involvement in the Republican Party and various other political and civic organizations, including the Brooklyn Masonic Veterans, the Grand Army of the Republic U.S. Grant Post No. 327, and the Department of Parks of the Boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. These items include announcements for and invitations to banquets and dinners; progams for commemorative ceremonies; circulars relating to Republican candidates in various elections; and the honorary ribbon worn by Dutcher as a Kings County Delegate to the 1904 New York State Republican Convention. Other items seem to relate to Dutcher's personal interest in American history, such as images of Abraham Lincoln and Alexander Hamilton, and handwritten copies of correspondence between Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee regarding the surrender at Appomattox Court House that ended the Civil War. Additional ephemeral items relate to the Dutcher family and include Sunday school cards and awards for Edith and Malcolm Dutcher; a children's coloring book; and a program for an opera at the Century Opera House.</p>

                    <p>This series consists of five large scrapbooks containing news clippings and ephemera compiled by Dutcher's wife, Rebecca, and his daughter, Jessie. Two of the scrapbooks contain articles clipped from various New York newspapers and relating to Dutcher's political and business careers, as well as several broad political and business issues. Together, these two scrapbooks offer an exhaustive account of the general political and business climates of the New York City area, New York State, and, to a lesser extent, the United States, from the mid-19th to the early 20th centuries. The remaining three scrapbooks also include articles on Dutcher's careers, but mainly focus on the personal interests of Rebecca and Jessie. These scrapbooks contain clippings of articles on theater, fine arts, literature, fashion, culinary arts, religion, Brooklyn history, and general social and cultural news. Clippings containing obituaries of personal friends, prominent New York citizens, and national celebrities are also included. While the clippings mainly relate to the New York City area, they also contain information on national and international events and issues. A variety of ephemera is also included in these three scrapbooks, including programs for theatrical productions, recitals, and lectures; commencement and excercise programs from various Brooklyn schools, including Girls' High School and Pratt Institute; programs for various community events; marriage invitations and announcements; advertisements; and images of performers and celebrities. One of these latter scrapbooks is housed separately from the rest of the collection in an oversize box.</p>
