            <abstract id="ref2" label="Abstract">The collection consists of records relating to New York City's Committee of Reception to the Crews of the Frigates "Cumberland" and "Congress." The committee was organized to raise money to aid survivors of the ships that were destroyed in March 1862 by the Confederate ironclad "Virginia" at Hampton Roads, Virginia, during the Civil War. The material in the collection dates mostly from 1862. It includes records concerning the determination of eligibility for claim payments, such as lists of survivors and seamen lost; correspondence regarding the relief funds; certifications of claimants regarding their identity and service on the frigates; and acknowledgements of funds received. The collection also includes donor lists and bills related to the fundraising effort.</abstract>

            <p>On March 8, 1862, the ironclad Confederate ship 
                <emph render="italic">Virginia</emph> (formerly the USS 
                <emph render="italic">Merrimack</emph>) attacked and destroyed the USS 
                <emph render="italic">Cumberland</emph> and USS 
                <emph render="italic">Congress</emph> at Hampton Roads, Virginia. Responding to the human casualties of this encounter, efforts were made in New York City to raise funds to contribute to the relief of crew members or surviving family. A Committee of Reception to the Crews of the Frigates "Cumberland" and "Congress" was formed to arrange an April 1862 reception at the Academy of Music in New York for officers and crew members. Money raised from tickets and donations were distributed for a time after the event. (See 
                <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> article "Honor to our brave tars," April 11, 1862.)</p>
