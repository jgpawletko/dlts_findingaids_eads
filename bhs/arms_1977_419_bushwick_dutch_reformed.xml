            <p>The Bushwick Dutch Reformed Church, commonly known as the Old Bushwick Reformed Church, was organized in 1654 in the Dutch settlement of Bushwick (or 
                <emph render="italic">Boswyck</emph>), one of the six original towns in what would later become known as Kings County. Located at the corner of Conselyea and Humboldt Streets, the Church's second structure was erected circa 1711, and its third in 1829. The Church was part of a collegiate comprised of Dutch Reformed churches in five of the six original towns of Kings County, including Brooklyn, Bushwick, Flatbush, Flatlands, and New Utrecht, as well as the town of Jamaica in Queens County. The Church's services were alternately administered every third Sunday by the pastors of the collegiate. Notable 18th- and 19th-century pastors at the church included Martinus Schoonmaker, Peter Lowe, Stephen H. Meeker, and Henry A. Powell. The church was demolished in the early 20th century.</p>
