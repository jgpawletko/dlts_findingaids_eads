            <p>Amos Pendleton Stanton (1802-1874) was a New York City wholesale grocer who resided at 177 Congress Street and 46 Monroe Place in Brooklyn. In 1874, while Stanton was ill with diabetes, his family petitioned the Court of Kings County to have him declared a "lunatic" so as to more quickly obtain his financial estate. In order to counter statements in Kings County public records that Stanton was mentally ill at the time of his death, his descendant, Frances Stanton O'Halek, later provided documentation that proved that Stanton had been receiving treatment at St. John's Episcopal Hospital for diabetes until his death.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>This collection includes copies of affidavits, title searches, and indentures pertaining to Amos P. Stanton. The documents were presumably compiled by Stanton's descendant, Frances Stanton O'Halek, in an attempt to show that, contrary to Kings County public records, Stanton was a diabetic rather than mentally ill at the time of his death. Documents span 1874 to 1974.</p>
