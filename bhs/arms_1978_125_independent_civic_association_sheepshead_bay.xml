            <p>The residential Brooklyn neighborhood of Sheepshead Bay was settled in the late 18th century and named for the abundance of local sheepshead fish. It is located on a bay of the same name that borders the Rockaway Inlet from the Atlantic Ocean. The neighborhood's boundaries were originally declared from the east side of Ocean Avenue to Plum(b) Beach Creek, and from the south side of Neck Road to the waterfront of Sheepshead Bay, but have since extended to being from the east side of Ocean Parkway to Plumb Beach, and from the south side of Kings Highway to Sheepshead Bay.</p>
            <p>The Independent Civic Association of Sheepshead Bay was founded in 1922, 24 years after Brooklyn's consolidation with New York City. The Association was one of 70 group members of the Brooklyn Civic Council, which addressed civic issues for the whole of Brooklyn. The Association's members were male, over the age of 21, and residents or property owners in Sheepshead Bay. The association's objectives focused on suggesting and securing community improvements and promoting community spirit.</p>
