            <p>The Brooklyn Clerical Union (formerly known as the Clerical Society of the City of Brooklyn) was formed on January 29, 1844 through the efforts of Maurice W. Dwight.

Dwight, First Reformed Dutch Church, President; Reverend J.L. Hodge, First Baptist Church, Vice-President; Reverend J. Poisal, Methodist (church unknown), Secretary; and Reverend George Duffield, Fifth Presbyterian Church, Treasurer.</p>
