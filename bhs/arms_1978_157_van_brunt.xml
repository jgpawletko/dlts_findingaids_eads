            <abstract id="ref2" label="Abstract">The Teunis G. Bergen collection of Van Brunt family genealogy papers spans the period 1770 to 1881 and measures 0.3 linear feet. The papers include letters, legal documents, and genealogical notes and transcriptions concerning the Van Brunt family, collected by Teunis G. Bergen. Much of the material concerns Kings County (N.Y.), especially New Utrecht (now part of Brooklyn), but New Jersey and other locales also appear in the genealogical documents. Many of the letters are from John Van Brunt (1802-1880) of Englewood, N.J.; these typically concern genealogy and family history, but some also include his perspectives on politics, the development of Englewood, and local issues such as a controversy over racially segregated schools. The legal documents include deeds, wills, and slave bills of sale.</abstract>

            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>The collection includes correspondence, genealogical notes, and legal documents primarily concerning the Van Brunt family compiled by Teunis G. Bergen. The bulk of the correspondence, ranging from 1827 to 1881, is of two categories: letters to Bergen from John Van Brunt of Englewood, New Jersey, on various topics and letters from various Van Brunts concerning family genealogy. John Van Brunt's correspondence typically concerns genealogy, historical inquiries, and general matters of family and friendship, but often also include his perspectives on national and local politics; the development of Englewood and the surrounding area, including reference to the Northern Railroad; a controversy concerning racially segregated schools in the town; and other matters. There are also two letters from Van Brunts, circa 1816, to a Catherine Conover.</p>
            <p>The genealogy notes compiled by Bergen cover various branches of the Van Brunt family. The notes include transcriptions from Bibles, deeds, and other documents. The legal documents include several related to the estate of Albert I. Van Brunt and Bergen's acquisition of property from the estate and Albert's heirs. There are several other wills, deeds, indentures, and the like in the collection. Some of the other surnames appearing in the legal documents are Debevoise, Denyse, and Lefferts. There are a small number of manuscript property maps. There are also nine deeds of sale for enslaved African-Americans, mostly between parties in New Utrecht (Kings County, N.Y.).</p>

            <p>Teunis G. Bergen (1806-1881) lived in the Bay Ridge area of New Utrecht (Kings County, N.Y.), now part of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Bergen was a farmer, surveyor, civic leader, Democratic Party politician, and, especially relevant to this collection, a historian and genealogist. Among his works was 
                <emph render="italic">Genealogy of the Van Brunt Family, 1653-1867</emph>, published in 1867. Bergen had a personal interest in the subject: he married Elizabeth Van Brunt (born 1804) in 1827.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth was the daughter of Rulef (1777-1833) and Gertrude (nee Cowenhoven; 1782-1865) Van Brunt. Rulef was the son of Jaques (1746-1811) and Mary/Maria (nee Johnson). Rulef's brother, Isaac Van Brunt, had a son, Albert I. Van Brunt (1761-1838). Albert I. was married to Cornelia (nee Bennet); they had two children, including Albert (born 1833). This is an abbreviated genealogy, noting individuals who appear in some of the legal documents in the collection, including in connection with transactions with Teunis Bergen. The source for this information is Bergen's genealogy of the Van Brunts; see pages 26-30. It can be found in the BHS library at call number CS71.V36338.</p>
            <p>While the names of many other Van Brunts appear in the collection, especially on correspondence to Bergen, two appear frequently and significantly enough to mention in this note: George Van Brunt and John Van Brunt. George appears on several legal documents, among them a will and bills of sale of enslaved African-Americans. George is likely that person appearing on page 44 of Bergen's book; he was born in 1769, lived in New Utrecht, and died in 1830. He married Aletta Lott and, after her death, Catherine Barre. One of his brothers was Rutgert W. Van Brunt, who appears on some transactions with George. Their father was Wilhemus Van Brunt. (See page 41-42 of Bergen.)</p>
            <p>John Van Brunt (1802-1880) was a businessman, originally from New York, who settled in New Jersey at some point, certainly by 1834, shortly after his 1830 marriage to Margaret Westervelt. John and Margaret lived in a village in Bergen County in what was then called English Neighborhood; in 1859 that village took a new name, Englewood. John was an organizer and officer of the Northern Railroad, which in the 1850s extended the train running from Jersey City to English Neighborhood on to the New York State line. John was a member of the Democratic Party and a state senator for two terms. Among other positions, he was Englewood's Town Superintendent for Education for 20 years. His father was Cornelius Van Brunt (1760-1827), who married Jannetie Adriance. Adriance was the name given to one of John and Margaret's sons; Adriance became an architect and some stationery with his letterhead is in the collection, used by John for his correspondence. (See page 39-40 of Bergen's book for genealogy. See Adaline W. Sterling, 
                <emph render="italic">The Book of Englewood</emph> for information about Van Brunt.)</p>
