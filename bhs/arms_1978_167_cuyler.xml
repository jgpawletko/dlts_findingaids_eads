            <p>Theodore Ledyard Cuyler (January 10, 1822-February 26, 1909) graduated from The College of New Jersey (later known as Princeton University) in 1841, and was ordained as a minister in 1848. On March 17, 1853, he married Annie E. Mathiot (d. July 12, 1915). In 1854, Cuyler founded the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in New York City. He was Brooklyn's leading proponent of the YMCA after he moved to Brooklyn, circa 1859. Cuyler also helped found the National Temperance Society and its publication house in 1865, serving as the Society's president from 1885 to 1893. Cuyler began serving as pastor of Brooklyn's Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church in 1860 and remained at that church until 1890. In 1885, Culyer started the Sunday Mission School on lower Atlantic Avenue in order to bring the Christian religious faith to the poor. The Sunday Mission School was soon known as Cuyler Presbyterian Church, located at 360 Pacific Street. In 1902, he published
