            <p>The Household of Faith Church collection dates from 1886 to 1922 and is housed in one manuscript box. The collection contains seven bound volumes that include reports, the church membership roll, clerks' books, and minutes. Reports and minutes document business meetings of the church, as well as meetings of the Board of Trustees. Clerks' books record baptisms and new members joining the church, as well as regular administrative decisions made at the church. Church rolls list members of the congregation and record member addresses, and dates joined and dismissed from the church.</p>

            <head>Historical note</head>
            <p>The Household of Faith congregation was organized in 1886 under the direction of Rev. William N. Pile, who led the church for two decades. In its first two years, the Household of Faith held services at temporary locations on Grand Street, then Liberty Hall at Gates and Nostrand Avenues in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. A new and permanent building for the church was opened in 1888, located on Greene Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Household of Faith followed the Adventist movement, and was also known as First Christian Advent Church of Brooklyn in the early 20th century.</p>
