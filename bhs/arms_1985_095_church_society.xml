            <p>The Brooklyn Church Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church was chartered in 1878. Its purpose was to advise member churches on matters of debt, referee real estate transactions between member churches, and support Sunday schools and missionary work in Brooklyn. Around 1900, the Society began expanding its work to the borough of Queens, and eventually the Society included parts of Long Island in the scope of its work as well. Accordingly, between 1916 and 1921 the Society's official name changed to The Brooklyn and Long Island Church Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>
