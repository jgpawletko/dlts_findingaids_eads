            <p>The Brooklyn Federation of Jewish Charities collection documents philanthropy and social aid work in Brooklyn's Jewish community during the early 20th century. It is comprised primarily of copies of the Federation's annual report spanning the years 1910 to 1920. These reports highlight the Federation's accomplishments for each year, including the amount of money raised and distributed to its affiliate organizations, the sources of those funds, and the work and accomplishments of the individual organizations that made up the Federation. Also included are a copy of the Federation's membership roster, dated 1921; a list of subscribers, dated 1926-1927; and several informational pamphlets that highlight the Federation's work and make appeals for donations.</p>
