            <p>The Brooklyn Home for Consumptives Annual Reports collection consists of 0.4 linear feet of material and spans the years 1882 to 1933. The collection contains all annual reports for the years 1882 to 1928, as well as the annual report for 1933. These documents feature summaries of the Home's activities and accomplishments for each year, the names of donors and donations made, as well as summaries of the Home's financial standing for each year. They do not include lists of patient names. Also included in the collection are two programs for a springtime fundraising event sponsored by the home, circa 1881-1933.</p>

            <head>Historical note</head>
            <p>The Brooklyn Home for Consumptives was incorporated as The Garfield Memorial Home on October 6, 1881 with the mission of providing shelter and care for tuberculosis patients and sufferers of other chronic ailments who could not find adequate care elsewhere. It was renamed the Brooklyn Home for Consumptives in 1882, and again renamed The Brooklyn Thoracic Hospital in 1938. The Home was originally located at 219 Raymond Street, and subsequently moved to a new building on Kingston Avenue in 1887, where the Home would remain until it closed in 1955. In 1956, the Brooklyn Thoracic Hospital merged with the Brooklyn Hospital, bringing the staff and trustees of both institutions together under one roof. As of 2010, the Brooklyn Hospital is still in operation and is known as the Brooklyn Hospital Center.</p>
