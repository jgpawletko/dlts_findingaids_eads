            <p>In colonial New York, the aged and infirm were cared for by family members or institutionalized in almshouses. Manhattan's first almshouse opened in 1736, with progressively larger facilities built as the elderly population grew. In contrast, Brooklyn's first public almshouse was not opened until 1870, as care provided by private organizations for the elderly was a more common option in Brooklyn. Many of these organizations were funded through church donations or philanthropists. For instance, the Brooklyn Society for the Relief of Respectable, Aged, Indigent Females was established in 1851 by John Bell Graham, and the Baptist Home of Brooklyn was founded in 1869 by the Long Island Baptist Association.</p>
