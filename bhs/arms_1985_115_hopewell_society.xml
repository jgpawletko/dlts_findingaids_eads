            <p>The Hopewell Society of Brooklyn annual reports and publications span the period 1871 to 1945. Annual reports of the Society feature summary information of the Society's yearly activities, in addition to lists of officers, managers, and committees; the Society's certificate of incorporation, constitution, and bylaws; lists of contributions and donations; and other information. Additional printed materials include an 1883 booklet containing an historical sketch of the Society, a booklet containing the Society's bylaws, brochures on the Society from 1943 and 1944, and annual reports of two of the Society's allied organizations, the Brooklyn Industrial School Association and Home for Destitute Children and the Home Association for Working Women and Girls. None of the annual reports featured in this collection include specific information on the individual residents being cared for by the above named organizations.</p>

            <p>The Hopewell Society of Brooklyn was incorporated in 1870 as the Society for the Aid of Friendless Women and Children. Its building was located at 20 Concord Street between Fulton and Washington Streets. The Society administered aid to destitute women and children, providing temporary housing, employment assistance, and educational and recreational programs. The Society's name was legally changed to the Hopewell Society of Brooklyn in 1921, and a year later the Society moved into a larger building, known as Hopewell House, at 218 Gates Avenue. In 1928 another building on Monroe Street was donated to the Society and was converted into a home and educational center for adolescent girls. The Society discontinued its programs for women in 1942, though it later began providing housing for elderly women at another property on Monroe Street.</p>
