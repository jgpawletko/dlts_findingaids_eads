            <p>The New York Congregational Home for the Aged was incorporated in 1910, and was funded by the Brooklyn-Manhattan Conference of Congregational Churches. Located in Brooklyn, the Home provided care and housing for elderly men and women affiliated with the Congregational denomination within Conference limits. Its original location was 125-127 Gates Avenue, but by 1917 it had relocated to 123 Linden Avenue. As of 2010, the Home continues to serve elderly members of the Congregational parish at 135 Linden Boulevard.</p>
