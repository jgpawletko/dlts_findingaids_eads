            <p>The Greenwood Baptist Church was established by a small prayer group in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Park Slope in 1858. Its first building was erected in 1863 at the corner of 4th Avenue and 15th Street. By the 1890s, the congregation had grown so substantially that the need for a larger building was recognized. In 1900, the church moved to a new edifice located at the corner of Sixth Street and Seventh Avenue in Park Slope, where it would remain throughout the 20th century. As of 2010, the church continues to occupy this location.</p>
