            <p>The South Congregational Church collection spans the years 1859 to 1953 and includes annual reports, three church manuals, a constitution and bylaws (1953), and various publications and programs published by the church.</p>
            <p>Though the annual reports span the years 1890 to 1953, they are incomplete. The 1890-1891 and 1910-1911 annual reports are included. The sequence then jumps to 1945 through 1953. The report for 1952 is not included. The reports provide detailed summaries of church finances, membership, committees, boards, activities, and clubs. The membership information includes the names of individuals who were added or removed from church membership for various reasons.</p>
            <p>The three church manuals (1859, 1864, and 1886) include a history of the church, names of the pastor, officers, and committee members, and descriptions of the church's beliefs, doctrines, principles, rules, and organizational structure.</p>
            <p>The church publications and programs span the years 1907 to 1951 and include anniversary and centennial programs, one sermon (1929), and two newsletters --

            <p>The South Congregational Church was established in May of 1851 in what is now the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn. Between 1851 and 1899, the church had installed six pastors, several of whom had become very influential within the Congregational denomination, including Rev. Rufus Wheelwright Clark, Rev. Henry M. Storrs, and Rev. Albert J. Lyman. Rev. Richard Salter Storrs provided the address at Lyman's 25th anniversary celebration in 1899.</p>
            <p>The church building, located at Court and President Streets, was built in several stages between the years 1857 to 1893. In 1857 the Romanesque Revival chapel was built, followed by a ladies' parlor in 1889, and the neo-Gothic rectory in 1893. As of 2010, the church and rectory had been converted into condominiums and the congregation of South Congregational Church merged with Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims located in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood.</p>
