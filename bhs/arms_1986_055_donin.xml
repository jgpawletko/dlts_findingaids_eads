            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>The Frances Donin collection on the Dutch Reformed Church, Flatbush and Flatlands measures 0.42 linear feet and dates from 1820 to 1964, with the bulk dating from 1870 to 1920. The collection includes church records, clippings, postcards, and one tintype. A large portion of the collection relates to the business of the Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church, including its account books, invoices, receipts, and correspondence with Brooklyn businesses, such as mechanics, upholsterers, and insurance agents. A pew plan shows the layout of the sanctuary and nave. In addition, pledge cards from 1920 list names--possibly church members--with home addresses.</p>
            <p>The Dutch Reformed Church of Flatlands is represented by postcards of the church's interior, and a booklet of recipes from the Ladies' Aid Society. Clippings include republished 19th century photographs of Flatbush and an article on the Jan Martense Schenck house on display at the Brooklyn Museum. The collection also contains a copy book and a manuscript hymnal, both belonging to John Ditmars, and a tintype of an unidentified woman.</p>

            <p>Both the Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church and the Dutch Reformed Church of Flatlands were founded in 1654, making them two of the three oldest congregations in the present-day borough of Brooklyn. The current Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church was built from 1793 to 1798 and the current Dutch Reformed Church of Flatlands was built in 1848. Both churches were landmarked by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1966.</p>
