            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The writings included in this collection were submitted by Daniel J. Kern to the Brooklyn Historical Society over a course of nearly two years. They cover a wide array of topics pertaining to Brooklyn history as experienced and observed through the eyes of Kern. Topics covered include Coney Island; Steeplechase and Luna Parks; the silent movie industry of Brooklyn and some of its stars; ice deliveries from the Knickerbocker Ice Company; Brooklyn's Trolley Cars; Castle Clinton; various ethnic group interactions; and some Jewish history. Throughout the pieces, Mr. Kern reminisces about businesses and places he knew as a child and compares the Brooklyn of his childhood to the Brooklyn of the early 1980s.</p>
