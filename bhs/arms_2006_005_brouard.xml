            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Royal W. Brouard was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. about 1891. At the age of 18, in November of 1909, he enlisted with the 12th Company of the New York Coast Artillery of the National Guard (13th Coast Defense Command). On August 5, 1917, he was drafted into federal service. The 13th Coast Defense Command became the 59th Artillery, Coastal Artillery Corps, and Brouard served with Battery F of the 59th Artillery. The 
                <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</emph> of October 20, 1918 notes that "The 59th, with its 1,100 members of the old 13th as its nucleus, is, of course, essentially a Brooklyn regiment, with a Brooklynite, Col. Sydney Grant, its commander." The 59th Artillery was the first Brooklyn organization sent to the line of battle in France and participated in the St. Mihiel drive, the Verdun offensive, and the battles of Argonne Forest and Romagne. Battery F in particular was recognized for its work at the Argonne.</p>
            <p>The 59th Artillery returned home to New York on January 24, 1919, and Brouard returned unwounded on the battleship USS 
                <emph render="italic">New Hampshire</emph>. He remained a member of the National Guard, achieving the rank of 2nd Lieutenant on December 24, 1920. In April of 1921, he resigned and received an honorable discharge from the National Guard.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The materials in this collection are arranged first by topic and then chronologically. They span the dates 1909 to 1922, with the bulk of the material dating from 1918 to 1919. Materials are comprised of military records, printed documents, correspondence, memorabilia, maps, and a scrapbook. The military records give evidence to Brouard's service in both the United States Army and in the National Guard. These records include enlistment records, appointments, and honorable discharge papers. Included are maps of the Vosges region in France that indicate the Allied Forces front line on July 18 and 19, 1918, and September 5, 1918.</p>
            <p>The collection also contains the complete run of 
                <emph render="italic">The Daily Log</emph>, the onboard daily publication of the USS 
                <emph render="italic">New Hampshire</emph> during its voyage from January 9 to January 23, 1919 from France to New York City. Included with 
                <emph render="italic">The Daily Log</emph> is a postcard bearing a photograph of the 
                <emph render="italic">New Hampshire</emph> addressed to Mrs. R.W. Brouard and dated January 10, 1919. Also included is a scrapbook that primarily contains newspaper clippings from the wartime period. The clippings date from 1915 to 1925, with the bulk dating from 1918.</p>
