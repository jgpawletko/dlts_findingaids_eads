            <p>Forty-five years ago, interracially married couples faced prosecution and jail time, or violence, if they happened to cross into one of sixteen states that prohibited and punished marriages on the basis of racial classifications . Sixty years ago, anti-miscegenation laws were on the books in thirty states. Eighty-two years ago, in 1930, the Hays Code forbade portrayals of interracial romance, curtailing the careers of actors of color like Anna May Wong who could no longer play romantic leads. In Germany in 1935, The Nuremberg Laws were introduced that prohibited marriage between Jewish Germans and other Germans. The only other nation to legislate against intermarriage was Apartheid South Africa in 1949. While interfaith marriages were not legally proscribed in the United States, interfaith and interclass marriages often met with opposition from family and community. And yet, in less than two generations since the last anti-miscegenation laws were removed, a study released by the Pew Research Center in 2010 reports that a record one out of seven new marriages in the United States were between spouses of a different race or ethnicity. The 2010 U.S. Census revealed that multiracial and multiethnic children are one of the country’s fastest-growing demographic groups.</p>
            <p>The Crossing Borders, Bridging Generations Project aims to explore these historical ideas through modern day interviews with multiple generations of Brooklynites. It is an oral history project and public programming series which examines the history and experiences of mixed-heritage people and families, cultural hybridity, race, ethnicity, and identity in the historically diverse borough of Brooklyn. Through sharing stories, we open up intergenerational conversations about preserving cultural heritage in a multicultural democracy. Narrators came to this project through connections with the project the interviewing team and CBBG public programs.</p>
            <p>Crossing Borders, Bridging Generations is a project of the Brooklyn Historical Society which builds upon BHS's oral history collections. Begun in 1973, the oral history collections contain interviews with more than 500 narrators and are available for listening in the Othmer Library. Crossing Borders, Bridging Generations is an ongoing project that is funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute for Museum and Library Services, and New York Council for the Humanities.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>The interviews in this collection are about mixed heritage identity and the borough of Brooklyn. For the purposes of this project, the definition of mixed was kept open and fluid, allowing narrators to have the space to describe themselves in their own words. Thought all interviewers took a life history approach to these interviews, they were collected by a team of over 25 interviewers and the content reflects different styles of interviewing and differing levels of famliarity between the interviewer and narrator.</p>

                    <p>During this interview, Ish offers a detailed account of what it was like to be raised by an interracial couple and how her life has been influenced by her mixed-heritage. She talks about celebrating the Chinese New Year and her Grandmother’s hybrid Chinese-American versions of traditional Chinese dishes, such as peanut butter bao. In addition to her own memories, Ish recalled stories of her Grandmother and Great Grandmother in Malaysia. In the interview, she reflects on what it was like to physically appear culturally ambiguous and how, as an avid traveler, this has given her an advantage as she can blend in almost anywhere in the world. She elaborates on these types of positive aspects of having a mixed-heritage, but also voices frustrations about racial prejudices towards Chinese culture in America. Ish also speaks about the experience of raising her daughter in Brooklyn and contemplates what her life will be like and how she will be perceived.</p>

He reflects on the differences between Judaism in Israel and in the U.S. He relates what a small and intimate community he grew up in, among Yemenite Jews, and the mix of Arab and Hebrew that he grew up speaking. He talks about how people never know what he is, whether he’s Mexican or Arab or Mediterranean. He talks about the way things like the Israeli army, travel, and the decision to be a doctor shaped him.</p>

                    <p>In her interview, Kanai explores her Japanese heritage. She speaks Japanese as her first language but remembers being treated poorly when she lived in Japan. In one instance, she visited Hiroshima with her mother and overheard people talking about them in Japanese. She moved to Lexington, Kentucky when she was eight years old. Kanai has a very strong connection to her own family history and is able to trace her family back through many generations.</p>

                    <p>Katherine Ambia grew up in Sunset Park, Brooklyn with her twin brother, her White-American mother and Peruvian father. She got her bachelor’s in Latin American studies from Wesleyan, her MSW from Columbia University, and is currently training as a clinician with the Yale Child Study Center's Intensive In-home Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Services program.</p>

                    <p>In this interview, Ambia discusses the way her racial identity has changed over time, from growing up in the culturally and economically mixed neighborhood of Sunset Park and attending a Quaker elementary school in Brooklyn Heights, to studying critical race theory formally as a young adult at Wesleyan University. Ambia elaborates on the cultural and economic backgrounds of her parents, who met as community organizers in the 1970s. She tells the story of her father’s childhood in a small indigenous village in Peru, his coming to the U.S., and his first experiences with American racism. She also tells the stories of her mother and maternal grandmother, an enterprising groundbreaker who worked in advertising in New York in the fifties, when the field was dominated by men.</p>
                    <p>She describes her parents as political organizers with a passion for worker and immigrant rights. Ambia remembers going to protests and growing up with those same values as a child. She also vividly accounts her personal experience of being mixed race, touching on the silence around the issue in her household, her trips to Peru to visit her father’s family, the messages she received from her maternal grandmother, as well as the racism she encountered in school from peers. As an adult, she reconciles her experience growing up mixed-race; how what she studied and whom she met in college has helped her develop a language around talking about her identity that she didn’t have as a child.</p>

                    <p>During his interview, David discusses his many identities: mixed-heritage, a student, and an athlete. He describes his transition from Middle School to High School and the social and academic adjustments that they demanded of him. David’s mixed heritage identity has impacted him throughout his upbringing in Brooklyn and life as a student. He tells the story of how his parents became acquainted and discusses the effect of cultural-mixing on his self-perception and reception of others. He describes his motivations for founding a club for mixed-heritage students at Stuyvesant High School and enumerates the discussions that the students partook in during meetings, including how mothers would often mix dishes from two cultures to create their own hybrid recipes. He also talks about how his mixed identity plays out in other areas of his life. For example, unlike most pitchers in baseball, he also hits and does not play the field.</p>

                    <p>In Ambia’s second interview, she goes into more into detail about her childhood experiences. She talks about feeling isolated or bullied at times during her childhood, while also feeling a close connection to her friends on her block and at her Quaker school. She describes her experience of female friendship as a kid; including where and when race came into that dynamic. She shows us the inside of her childhood home: filled with elaborate games, toys, art projects, Disney movies, story writing, no television and a lot of health food. Ambia also talks about her interest in sports, cooking, and holistic health helped her connect with her father.</p>
                    <p>Ambia talks about the differing ideas of race within her own family and how her brother’s experience around these issues differs from her own. She also relates how her family would celebrate holidays with the two separate sides of her multiracial family, and she tells stories about the differing rituals. She goes on to talk about her parents’ separation in high school and what she has learned about relationships from watching her own family. She describes her own experiences of dating and her racial identity.</p>
                    <p>Ambia also focuses a lot on the effect her education has had on who she is today. She talks about teachers who’ve profoundly affected her both before and in college, exciting her interest in literature, race in society, social justice and her own cultural background. She tells us is in detail about her formative year abroad in Bolivia and more generally, about her broad and rich education at Wesleyan and the acceptance she found there. At the end of the interview, she talks about her choices around her profession. Ambia talks about how her commitment to social justice and equality contributed to her decision to become a therapist. She discusses some possible long-term goals such as building a psychiatric practice and expresses her enthusiasm for the CBBG project and the importance of this kind of work.</p>

                    <p>In this interview, Hong talks about her experiences being multiracial at a time and in a place where it was largely misunderstood. She grew up in Miami, Florida where her father owned and operated a Chinese restaurant, of which she holds fond memories. Most people in Miami assumed she was Cuban or Native American. Most people did not think Hong was Asian and most of the Asians in the area were a part of her family. She also talks about having visited Hawaii which was one of the only times she has felt like she has totally blended in. She spends time reflecting on the difference in attitude and acceptance toward multiracial people in the 1970s and the present. Hong wonders how her life would have been different if she hadn't grown up with a Chinese name, which both her and her sister were given. She also talks about her experience answering the question "what are you?" which she got asked many times growing up. Her feelings and answers to this question have changed over her lifetime.</p>

                    <p>In this interview, Blazon describes what it was like to grow up Hapa in New Hampshire. He talks about being bullied and never being seen as Chinese despite identifying more with his Chinese heritage than his French Canadian background. Blazon discusses life in his family’s restaurant in New Hampshire. He talks about living in France for ten years and what it was like to return to Brooklyn where he noticed significant changes in the attitude toward and understanding of mixed heritage people. He thinks about how his own feelings of being Hapa will affect his daughter.</p>

                    <p>Elizabeth Velazquez was raised in Sullivan County in upstate New York. As the daughter of two immigrants (a Puerto Rican father and a Peruvian mother), Velazquez feels connected to the students in her Art classes at PS 89, Cypress Hills Community School, which is a bilingual school predominantly comprised of students of Latin American backgrounds. Velazquez is dedicated to learning more about her background and her family history, which are themes that often arise in her personal art practice.</p>

                <scopecontent id="ref108">
                    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                    <p>During this interview, which was conducted in Velazquez's art studio, Velazquez discusses her ongoing quest for knowledge, what she refers to as a lost history, in order to feel a greater connection to the past. She discusses feeling lost and never fitting in, whether in the US, in Puerto Rico, or in Peru, while feeling connected to her students in Brooklyn, who come from similar backgrounds.</p>
                    <p>Growing up in upstate NY, Velazquez remembers looking around in her classes to identify someone else like her. She reflects on being raised Pentacostal, and feeling grateful for experiencing the food and music of other Latin American and Caribbean church members. She also discusses observing her father building and fixing things, which she later understood as a reflection of Puerto Rican history in her dad, who she views as an embodiment of where he grew up. As an adult, Velazquez seeks to fill the loss of ancestral knowledge, which she admits often results in anger mixed with a feeling of wanting to be at peace, which she compares to fighting a phantom.</p>
