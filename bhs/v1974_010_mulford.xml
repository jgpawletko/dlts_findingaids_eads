            <p>The Mulford family photograph collection, dating from circa 1880 to 1930, is housed in two glass plate negative boxes and one manuscript box measuring 1.42 linear feet. The collection consists of 97 black-and-white glass plate negatives and film negatives and 93 black-and-white photographic prints (developed from the glass plate negatives and film negatives). The collection provides street views of what is today the Prospect-Lefferts Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, views of Prospect Park in winter and summer, photographs of Mulford family members and other unidentified people (presumably also family members or friends) taken at the Mulford family home or around their neighborhood, and exterior and interior views of the Mulford family house located at 240 Hawthorne Street. Only a few of the photographs include the names of the sitters in the photographs. Joe Mulford (presumably the father and owner of the house located at 240 Hawthorne) and Edith Mulford (presumably his daughter) are identified.</p>
