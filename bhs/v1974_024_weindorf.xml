            <head>Biographical note</head>
            <p>Arthur Weindorf (1885-1979) was a Queens-born illustrator and artist. Weindorf provided illustrations for newspapers and magazines in addition to exhibiting original paintings and drawings. In 1908, he began his career at the Public Service Commission of the City of New York, a predecessor agency to the New York City Transit Authority. As an engineer and designer, Weindorf created models and drawings of subway tunnels and stations for the Commission.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The Arthur Weindorf glass plate negatives date from circa 1901 to 1920 and contain 224 items. The negatives document the construction of the sewer system and subway tunnels in Brooklyn. Sewer images in the collection are located in Brooklyn, mainly in the Brooklyn Heights and Downtown Brooklyn neighborhoods, and show excavation and bracing of tunnels, construction workers, tunnel interiors, pipe yards, street-level views of drainage (called catch basins), and street-level photographs with hand-illustrated underground renderings of pipe placement. Subway stations include the Clark Street station in Brooklyn Heights, the 4th Avenue station in Park Slope, and the Coney Island train yard. Subway tunnel-related negatives mainly show models and illustrated plans. In addition, the collection contains street scenes and photographs of open air markets in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>
            <p>A small number of film negatives and prints from glass plate negatives are also included.</p>
