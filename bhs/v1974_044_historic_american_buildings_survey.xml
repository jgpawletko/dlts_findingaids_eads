            <p>The Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) was a project started by the New Deal-funded Works Progress Administration (WPA) for the purpose of employing people to document historic buildings in the United States. In Brooklyn, Stanley P. Mixon was employed by the HABS project to photograph historic buildings throughout the borough in 1940.</p>
            <p>The Wyckoff-Bennett Homestead, built in the Dutch colonial style, is located at 1669 East 22nd Street (near Kings Highway) in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn. Presumably built by descendants of Pieter Wyckoff, Abraham and Henry Wyckoff, the house and barn are believed to have been completed circa 1760. In 1835, the house was purchased by Cornelius W. Bennett. As of 2011, his descendants continue to occupy the house. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977. In Brooklyn, Dutch colonial houses were built by early Dutch settlers, and their descendants, to resemble the architecture of the Netherlands. Dutch colonial houses in Brooklyn are identifiable by their gambrel roofs (typically a symmetrical two-sided roof consisting of two slopes), curved projecting eaves, end chimneys, shingled siding, and south facing entrances.</p>
            <p>Erasmus Hall Academy was established in 1787 as a private, all-male academy in what is the present-day neighborhood of Flatbush. Erasmus Hall, the original wooden Federal style building, was completed in 1787. Today, the building is located at the center of the quadrangle that comprises Erasmus Hall High School. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.</p>
            <p>The Old Stone House, also referred to as the Vechte-Cortelyou House, was built by Nicholas Vechte in 1699. Originally located along Gowanus Creek, the house became a battle site during the American Revolutionary War. In 1797, the house was sold to the Cortelyou family, but by the 1890s it had been demolished. The site where the house stood was rediscovered in the 1930s and original stones that were recovered from an excavation of the site were used to rebuild a replica of the house. As of 2011, the house serves as an historic interpretive center, operated by First Battle Revival Alliance, and is located in Washington Park within the borders of the Park Slope and Gowanus neighborhoods of Brooklyn.</p>
            <p>The Sands Mansion was located at 31 Front Street in what is the present-day Brooklyn neighborhood of DUMBO. The mansion was built by Joshua Sands, a merchant and politician. The three-story Federal style mansion was the largest mansion in Brooklyn when it was completed in 1787. Ann Sands, his wife, is accredited as being a founding member of St. Ann's Church (originally known as The Episcopal Church of Brooklyn), the oldest Episcopal parish in Brooklyn and incorporated in 1787. Ann Sands hosted weekly church gatherings in the mansion for many years.</p>

            <p>The Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) photographs of colonial buildings in Brooklyn is comprised of 47 black-and-white photographic prints, dating from 1940. The photographer, Stanley P. Mixon, was employed by the HABS project to document historic buildings throughout the United States. This collection documents four buildings located in Brooklyn, N.Y.: the Wyckoff-Bennett Homestead (1760), Erasmus Hall (1787), the Old Stone House (also known at the Vechte-Cortelyou House; 1699), and the Sands Mansion (1787). All photographs were taken within a two-day period, on either March 18, 1940 or March 19, 1940. Photographs of exterior views, interior views, and detail views are included in the collection. The prints are 5 x 7, though the collection contains one 7.5 x 10 print of Erasmus Hall, photographed by George B. Brainard. This photograph was not created as part of the HABS project.</p>
