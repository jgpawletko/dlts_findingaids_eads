            <p>The Steven W. Giles glass plate negatives and other photographic material dates from 1898 to circa 1910 and contains 136 items. The collection is composed of glass plate negatives, film negatives, prints, and a scrapbook by Flatbush resident Steven W. Giles. The images show houses, businesses, and street scenes in the Flatbush and Flatlands neighborhoods of Brooklyn, concentrated on or around Flatbush Avenue and Kings Highway. In addition to notable Dutch homesteads such as the Williamson, Story, Jeremiah Lott, Cornelius Kouwenhoven, John Ditmas, and Remsen houses, the collection also includes images of storefronts, taverns, hotels, and barns. The scrapbook contains clippings and ephemera related to Flatbush and Brooklyn social events and cultural news, such as the openings of parks, libraries, and monuments.</p>
            <p>Many images are identified with street names, cross streets, house numbers, or owner names. Contact prints exist for most negatives in the collection, as well as a small number of enlargement prints.</p>
