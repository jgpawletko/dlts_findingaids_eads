            <p>The Prospect Park lantern slide collection dates from circa 1886 to 1929 and contains 91 items. The collection includes both black-and-white and hand-colored lantern slides. The slides show Prospect Park from the time of construction to the 1920s, as well as the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens and notable Brooklyn buildings. Images show park activities, such as group recreation, sports, and gatherings; statues and monuments; construction of the park; horticultural and holiday displays; large areas of the park, such as the parade grounds, Prospect Park Zoo, Prospect Park Lake, Long Meadow, and various walkways; and aerial views of the entire park.</p>
            <p>Some lantern slides in the collection originate from commercial slide studios, namely Edward Van Altena and Breseler Lantern Slides Co. One copy print is also available.</p>

            <p>Prospect Park, located in Brooklyn, N.Y. was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the landscape architects responsible for Central Park and Riverside Park in Manhattan. Construction began in 1866 and continued into the 1870s. The park's design included a meadow, wooded ravine, and lake. Prospect Park was immensely popular upon opening, and attracted visitors from across the social classes. The park's rural scenery and recreation areas were supplemented by new features such as a zoo and playgrounds in the early 20th century. As of 2011, Prospect Park is one of the largest parks in Brooklyn and receives over eight million visitors each year.</p>
