            <p>The Ralph Irving Lloyd lantern slides, spanning the period circa 1890 to 1920, measure 3.5 linear feet and are housed in seven lantern slide boxes. The collection consists of (roughly) 400 black-and-white lantern slides, created by Lloyd, that depict 17th, 18th, and 19th century historic houses, homesteads, churches, storefronts, cemeteries and sepulchral monuments (gravestones), and schools in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan; and 19th and early 20th century street scenes of Brooklyn. The images of buildings are predominantly exterior views, but the collection does have several interior views. The collection also includes several images of locations in New York State and in Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>The collection is organized into three series: 
                <emph render="bold">Series 1: Lantern slides of Brooklyn</emph>; 
                <emph render="bold">Series 2: Lantern slides of Queens</emph>; and 
                <emph render="bold">Series 3: Lantern slides of Manhattan and other locations</emph></p>
            <p>Boxes 1-3 contain - Series 1: Lantern slides of Brooklyn</p>
            <p>Box 4 contains - Series 2: Lantern slides of Queens</p>
            <p>Boxes 5-7 contain - Series: Lantern slides of Manhattan and other locations</p>

            <head>Biographical note</head>
            <p>Dr. Ralph Irving Lloyd (1875-1969) was a Brooklyn ophthalmologist and an avid amateur photographer. Lloyd was born in Poughkeepsie, N.Y on September 11, 1875. He attended high school in Poughkeepsie and graduated in 1892. After high school, he completed advanced classes in science and language and was then admitted to The New York Homeopathic Medical College from which he graduated in 1896. Between 1896 and 1897, he served for one year as house physician at the Brooklyn Homeopathic Hospital. Following the service in a similar position in Pittsburgh, PA, Lloyd returned to New York City in 1898 for further medical training at the New York Ophthalmic Hospital. Upon finishing his training, he opened an office in Brooklyn for the general practice of medicine in 1899.</p>
            <p>In 1926, Lloyd pursued further medical studies in Europe and on his return to Brooklyn devoted his medical practice to ophthalmology. Lloyd served as assistant professor, and eventually professor, at the New York Homeopathic Medical College and Hospital and it was during this time that he wrote and lectured extensively on ophthalmology. He was one of the founders of the Brooklyn Ophthalmological Society for which he also served as president, and he also served as president of the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology at which he achieved the status of Life Fellow.</p>
            <p>In 1905, Lloyd married Nettie Hesson Limberg who died in 1937. In 1942, Lloyd married Carrie Orr Fleming, a teacher, who taught school for more than 30 years in New York City. He lived at 14 8th Avenue (near Flatbush Avenue) in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. Following retirement in 1959, Lloyd continued to pursue many activities and hobbies, most notably the collection and repair of antique clocks and amateur photography. Over the years, the subject of his photography was primarily historic 17th, 18th, and 19th century houses and homesteads located in the New York City metropolitan area, with many in Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island. Lloyd died in Brooklyn on May 9, 1969.</p>
