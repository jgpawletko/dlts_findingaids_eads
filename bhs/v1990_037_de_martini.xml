            <p>The Celestine De Martini photographs of the Ryder Club Grand March and the Italian American Civic Union Banquet is comprised of two black-and-white group portraits. One group portrait shows the annual banquet of the Italian American Civic Union, held on Columbus Day, 1913. The photographer was J. G. Waters. The second group portrait shows a large group of men and women in formal dress at Prospect Hall in Brooklyn performing the Grand March during a ball held by the Ryder Club, 1914. The photographer was by M. Gorodess. De Martini's father is in both photographs, but is not specifically identified.</p>
