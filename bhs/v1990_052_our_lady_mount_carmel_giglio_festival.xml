            <p>The Our Lady of Mount Carmel Giglio Feast photographs consist of three black-and-white photographic prints relating to the annual Giglio Feast held in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, circa 1950. The collection includes two interior views of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church during the Giglio Feast celebration and one exterior view of participants in procession from the church gathering on Union Avenue in Williamsburg. The photographs were displayed in the Brooklyn Historical Society exhibition, "The Giglio: Brooklyn's Dancing Tower."</p>

            <head>Historical note</head>
            <p>The Feast of the Giglio (sometimes referred to as the Feast of St. Paulinus or San Paolino) is an annual Catholic celebration held by Italian Americans in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx. In 1903, the first annual Feast of the Giglio was celebrated in the streets of the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. On feast day, or Giglio Sunday (held in July), celebrants proceed through the streets following a 65 foot high Giglio tower. The immigrants who celebrated the first annual Feast of the Giglio predominantly came from the city of Nola, located in the Campania region of southern Italy, where the feast originates. As of 2011, the feast is still held at the same location in Williamsburg, centered near Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church.</p>
