            <p>Billy Cunningham was born in Brooklyn on June 3, 1943. He graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn and then attended the University of North Carolina at which he also played basketball. Cunningham went on to play professional basketball for the Philadelphia 76ers from 1965 to 1972 and then again from 1974 to 1976. He served as head coach of the 76ers from 1977 to 1985. Cunningham's nickname, "Kangaroo Kid," referred to his rebounding ability. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame (as a player) in 1986.</p>
