            <p>The Beatrice Roman family photographs, dating from circa 1860 to 1920, consist of two black-and-white photographs and one photograph album containing both cartes-de-visite and cabinet photographs. The collection documents several families from which Beatrice Roman descended including the Koch family and the Peter family, both of which settled in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bay Ridge. The collection consists of studio portraits with the exception of one group photograph showing boys dressed in military-style uniforms, surrounding a man who is possibly their teacher. The only sitter in the portraits that is identified is Herbert Self, a grocer from Bay Ridge.</p>

            <head>Biographical note</head>
            <p>Beatrice Roman (full name Beatrice Koch Wehmann Roman) descended from German immigrants who settled in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn. Her maternal great-grandfather was Philip Koch (1822-1893), a carousel maker who emigrated from Germany circa 1848. Philip's son William Koch (also known as Billy Cook or Billy Koch), owned "Billy Cook's Saloon" in Bay Ridge which purportedly had a bowling alley in the basement. William Koch later became involved in the real estate business and was also an amateur photographer. Beatrice Roman's paternal great-grandfather, Henry Peter (d. 1883), also left Germany circa 1848, and was a builder who constructed large homes along Shore Road in Brooklyn. Beatrice Roman married Stephen W. Roman.</p>
