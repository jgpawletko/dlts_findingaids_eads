            <p>The Dwight B. Demeritt, Jr. photographs of the Cadman Plaza excavation site contains 14 3.5 x 3.5 inch black-and-white photographic prints, dating from 1965, showing views of the excavation site of a parcel of land in Brooklyn Heights that had been razed for the construction of Cadman Plaza. Included in the photographs are views of an excavated cistern and an excavated wind box of a pipe organ that was uncovered seven feet below street level. Views of the vacant lot, surrounding buildings, and people in the vacant lot are also represented. The photographs were taken by Dwight B. Demeritt, Jr. and include handwritten descriptions on the verso.</p>

            <head>Historical note</head>
            <p>In the summer of 1965, Terry Lymon and several assistants undertook an archaeological excavation of a parcel of land located in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood and bounded by Fulton, Middagh, and Henry Streets. The land had recently been razed for the construction of Cadman Plaza. In the course of their excavation, the team uncovered several cisterns and dry wells, as well as many artifacts, including bottles, ceramics, part of a pipe organ, and a pair of men's pants dating from the 19th century. Lymon, along with two of the excavation team members, Martin Schneider and Dwight B. Demeritt Jr., presented their findings at a lecture hosted by the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) on September 20, 1965.</p>
