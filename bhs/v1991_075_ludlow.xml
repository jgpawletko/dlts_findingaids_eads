            <p>The Theodore Russell Ludlow photographs consist of 56 black-and-white photographic prints dating from circa 1890 to 1920. The photographs document Ludlow during various stages of his life, ranging from his teenage years, through his subsequent marriage to Helen Roosevelt Lincoln, to the birth of their three children. The majority of the photographs are informal portraits and group portraits, many including Ludlow. Some of the photographs include handwritten descriptions on the recto, identifying the people and places in the photographs. Other photographs have no descriptions. Given the biographical information that is known about Ludlow, it is presumed that many of the photographs pertaining to his years as a teenager, through his time at university, were taken in Brooklyn, N.Y. The collection also includes several photographs of Ludlow while he was serving as a missionary in China.</p>

            <head>Biographical note</head>
            <p>Theodore Russell Ludlow (1883-1961) was born in Valley Creek, TX on July 14, 1883. As a child, Ludlow went to live with Edward Augustus Caner and his wife Cornelia (nee Vermilye) in Brooklyn, N.Y. Caner was an accountant and amateur photographer, and Ludlow was the subject of many of his photographs. Ludlow attended seminary at the Episcopal Theological School (now the Episcopal Divinity School) in Cambridge, MA and became a priest. In this capacity, he served as a missionary in China, circa 1914 to 1915. Ludlow also attended Columbia University where he studied law. Ludlow went on to become Bishop of Newark, N.J. from 1936 to 1953. He married Helen Roosevelt Lincoln (1890-1985) on June 11, 1911 in Cambridge, MA and they had at least three sons.</p>
