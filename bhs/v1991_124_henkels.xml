            <p>Wyckoff Heights Medical Center opened in 1899 as the German Hospital in Brooklyn. In 1886, the Plattdeutscher Volksfest-Verein sought to build a hospital to serve Brooklyn's large German and German-American community. In 1889, the German Hospital Society of Brooklyn was established to spearhead the fundraising for and construction of the hospital. The cornerstone of the German Hospital in Brooklyn was laid in 1894 and the four-story red brick building was dedicated in 1899. The architect was Brooklyn-based architect Rudolph L. Daus (1854-1916). The original hospital consisted of four buildings connected by covered passages and was located on St. Nicholas Avenue between Stockholm and Stanhope Streets. The name of the hospital was changed to Wyckoff Heights Hospital on November 11, 1918. On November 14, 1991, architect Charles H. Henkels photographed portions of the exterior and interior of the building in relation to its scheduled demolition as part of the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center modernization project.</p>
