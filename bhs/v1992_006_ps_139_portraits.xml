            <p>The Group portrait photographs of classes at P.S. 139 in Flatbush consist of two black-and-white mounted photographic prints showing classes at P. S. 139, located in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, circa 1915. Both photographs include notes on the verso identifying the school and its location. One photograph includes a handwritten note on the verso naming "Mordorf" as principal and also names "Marta Boderstrom Riedemann," presumably a student in the photograph.</p>
