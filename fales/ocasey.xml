                <emph render="bold">Sean O'Casey (1880-1964)</emph> was an Irish playwright and memoirist noted for his portrayal of the lives of Ireland's working class and poor. O'Casey was born in Dublin in 1880 and struggled in his early life with poverty and illness. He became involved in the Irish nationalist movement, was noted for his socialist and communist political beliefs, and was often critical of the Catholic Church. O'Casey's first significant success as a dramatist came with the acceptance and production of 
                <emph render="italic">The Shadow of a Gunman</emph> by the Abbey Theatre in Dublin in 1923. The Abbey Theatre would produce several of his subsequent plays, including 
                <emph render="italic">Juno and the Paycock</emph>, and 
                <emph render="italic">The Plough and the Stars</emph>, which caused riots after being criticized as anti-Irish. In 1926, O'Casey went to London on what was intended to be a short visit, but decided to remain in England as a result of disputes with the Abbey Theatre and several figures in the Irish literary community. He continued to write and produced several other notable dramatic works, including 
                <emph render="italic">Purple Dust</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Red Roses for Me</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Cock-A-Doodle Dandy</emph>, and 
                <emph render="italic">The Bishop's Bonfire</emph>. O'Casey also produced an autobiography that was released in six individual volumes from 1939 to 1954. Sean O'Casey is regarded as one of the leading Irish playwrights of the 20th Century. (1)
