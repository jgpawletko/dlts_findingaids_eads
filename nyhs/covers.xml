            <p>This collection consists of philatelic covers and other decorative envelopes spanning the period from 1861 to 1989. It includes first day and cacheted covers, first flight covers, advertising covers, and examples of tax stamps and other early stamps. The collection is organized topically into the following five folders.</p>
            <p>Advertising covers span the period from mid-19th to early 20th century, and include hotels and other businesses, products, and lawyers and professional associations. There are a number of envelopes advertising the Acme Haversack of Song and Patriotic Eloquence, published in Syracuse, New York.</p>
            <p>First day and cacheted covers commemorate a variety of historical events and people, including the Lake Placid 1932 Olympics, the First Pony Express, the first anniversary of D-Day, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Also included is a Zeppelin envelope.</p>
            <p>First flight envelopes include domestic and international mail routes.</p>
            <p>Tax and other early stamps include two cartes-des-visites and several bank notes with tax stamps, a few civil-war era stamped envelopes, and other examples of pre-20th century stamps.</p>
            <p>Some of the envelopes were stored in a special case which is included in the last folder of the collection.</p>
