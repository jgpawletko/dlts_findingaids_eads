            <p>The precursor to paper dolls were the French pantins, human figures printed with detached limbs meant to be re-attached with string. Paper dolls as we know them today, human figures with changeable costumes, were first manufactured in England in the late 18th century. The earliest paper dolls printed in America were made in the early 19th century. By the 1870s, paper dolls had become quite popular in the United States; production of sets of dolls increased as their popularity grew and as chromolithography made color printing more cost effective. Paper dolls were made and sold by commercial firms both for children to play with and for adults to observe current fashion trends. Women's magazines and newspaper supplements often included cutouts of paper dolls and/or their clothes.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Paper Doll Collection spans the period from ca. 1850 to 1911 and contains both commercially produced and handmade paper dolls. Dolls in the collection were produced in both Europe and the United States. Sets of dolls, most of which have a distinct provenance, are kept together. Dolls are arranged by size.</p>
            <p>Two Jenny Lind paper dolls and their accompanying dresses were made in Germany ca. 1850. The two dolls are quite similar, with only slight differences in facial features and tilt of the head. The clothing illustrates costumes worn by Lind in many of her featured roles.</p>
            <p>Three folders hold a notable element of the collection, a large set of handmade paper clothes for paper dolls. Some of the dolls were cut from newspaper illustrations, and others were commercially manufactured paper dolls. The dolls often have names and ages of characters written on the verso. Some clothes were also cut from newsprint, but most were handmade using collages of different colors, patterns, and weights of paper, and sometimes tissue or lace doilies. The clothing is extremely detailed. Women's dresses often have matching purses attached to the dresses. Clothes made for a specific doll have been matched with that doll when possible, and are stored together in an envelope. Many of the outfits do not seem to correspond to the surviving dolls. The Victorian-style clothing fashions date the dolls from between 1880 and 1900.</p>
            <p>A set of 36 paper dresses for a woman paper doll were originally printed in the Sunday supplement to the 
                <title type="simple">
                    <emph render="italic">Boston Sunday Herald</emph> </title>throughout 1895 and 1896. Sports costumes, evening and afternoon dresses in various fashions of the moment are included.</p>
            <p>"Lady Edith" includes one doll and three outfits with matching hats. This set was issued in 1894 by London printers Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons, the major English producer of paper dolls, for sale in the United States. One sheet contains a brightly colored doll and clothes—not cut out—entitled "Polly's Paper Playmates: Cousin Janet at an afternoon tea." The sheet was a supplement to the 
                <title type="simple">
                    <emph render="italic">New York Sunday American</emph> </title> in 1911. One folder includes die cut paper furniture for the paper dolls. The patterns for an armchair and bureau are uncut; the envelope they were sold in is also included. The envelope text reads: "The Girl's Delight: Paper Furniture (No. 1) for Paper Dolls." "The Girls' Delight" was a series of paper dolls printed in ca. 1857 by Clark, Austin &amp; Smith, of 3 Park Row, New York.</p>
