            <p>The papers of the Duffie family consist primarily of legal documents concerning the development and sale of the Kips Bay Farm property in the Murray Hill area. Contained within these documents, the majority dated May 15, 1851, is information regarding the last will and testament of John Duffie, and his heirs. Also included are bills and receipts regarding the building of St. John the Baptist Church and its rectory. One item is a notice to the restoration workers of the church reminding them that their behavior should be reverent while they are working in a "House of God."</p>
            <p>Folders 1 and 2 pertain to the sale of property on May 15, 1851, predominantly in the 18th Ward of NYC in the area bounded by Third and Lexington Avenues and 38th and 39th Streets; folder 3 consists of papers relating to the building of St. John the Baptist Church; folder 4 consists of correspondence and receipts relating to the house at the corner of Lexington Avenue and 35th Street (probably the Rectory); and folder 5 contains four miscellaneous items, including 2 photographic images of a young boy.</p>
