            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>David Span, a Jewish American from the Bronx, NY, was born on April 17th, 1921 to Joseph and Jennie Span. He was working as a machinist at the time of his enlistment. David Span enlisted as an Army Warrant Officer on February 18th, 1943, and was shortly after sent to Camp Upton in Long Island, New York.</p>
            <p>David spent most of 1943 at various Army Air Force training facilities, such as the Army Air Force Technical School in Lincoln, Nebraska and Dale Mabry Field in Talahassee, Florida. David's brother, Murray, was stationed in South Carolina before being shipped to fight in France. It is not known from the letters the extent of David Span's service during the subsequent years of the war, 1944-1945. David Span died on August 20th, 1973, and was buried at the Long Island National Cemetary in Pinelawn, N.Y.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection contains approximately one hundred and thirty three letters, most of which are written by David Span to his parents, Joseph Span and Jennie Span, and to his brother, Murray Span, who was serving in the United States Army. There are also letters from Murray Span to his parents, as well as several letters to Murray from friends of his who were also serving in various branches of the Armed Forces.</p>
            <p>In the letters, David writes about his training in the Army Air Force at various bases across the country. There are also a few letters where he speaks about his interactions with other Jewish Americans in the Army. Highlights of the correspondence include: a 1943 letter from a Jewish chaplain to Mr. and Mrs. Span about how David would be given full opportunity to practice his religion, and a newspaper printed for airmen at Republic Aviation Corp. in Farmingdale, L.I.</p>
            <p>In addition to the typed and hand-written letters the collection contains a telegram, a holiday card from David to Murray, and a few printed items and ephemera. One letter from Sgt. B. ["Benie"] Epstein to Mrs. H. Epstein most likely ended up with these letters due to the fact that Murray Span and "Benie" Epstein were friends, as Benie wrote him multiple letters during the War.</p>
