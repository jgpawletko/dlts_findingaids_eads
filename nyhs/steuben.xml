            <p>The physical collection consists of 15 boxes of correspondence and writings (1 oversize) from 1778 to 1851 and 6 volumes. Many documents are in French.</p>
            <p>The bulk of the correspondence (1779-1781) concerns Steuben's efforts to reorganize the Continental Army and to make Virginia a base of General Nathaniel Greene's army during Steuben's command of forces there. They relate to matters including the preparation and distribution of his Regulations, reactions to and questions about his work, appointment of inspectors, supply needs, organization and administration of army and militia units, enemy movements and strength, and British forces in Virgina, among other topics.</p>
            <p>Steuben's correspondents include Col. Jean Baptiste Ternant, Col. William Davies, the Board of War, M. de Franey, Chevalier de la Luzerne, Gen. Nathanael Greene, Gov. Thomas Jefferson, Col. Edward Carrington, Col. George Gibson, Gen. Thomas Nelson, Gen. George Weedon, Gen. Peter Muhlenberg, Louis de Pontiere, Gen. Robert Lawson, Gen. Isaac Gregory, Col. J. Junis, Gen. Mordecai Gist, Maj. Buller Claiborne, Capt. John Pryor, Capt. William North, Col. Benjamin Walker, and Gen. Benjamin Lincoln.</p>
            <p>The correspondence from 1778 to 1789 has been microfilmed on reels 1, 2, and 3 (which correspond to boxes 1-3) and will be presented in this format.</p>
            <p>The volumes include a letter book dealing with official military matters and including correspondence addressed to the War Board, George Washington, and other officers (1780 January - 1781 January); "Regulations pour la cavalerie ou corps legionaire [sic]" (partly in English), discussing the reorganization of the Continental Army's cavalry units in 1780-1781; "Thoughts on a national militia", containing several miscellaneous documents in French and English discussing the establishment of a peacetime army (ca. 1784); "Thoughts on the growth of the western territory," discussing political relations with Spain and Britain, and proposing settlements in Spanish Louisiana (ca. 1788); and a journal, in French, describing work, relations with tenants, and projected improvements on his farm in Oneida County, New York (1790-1792).</p>
            <p>These five volumes have been microfilmed on reel 4 (which corresponds to box 4) and will be presented in this format.</p>
            <p>The volume "The Exercise of Troops" (in French), undated but bound within covers that are pages of a 1778 newspaper, has not been microfilmed.</p>
