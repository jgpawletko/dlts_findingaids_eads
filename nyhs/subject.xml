            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Subject File spans the period from ca. 1600 to ca. 1976 and primarily contains images of American history and life. The collection is divided into three series by size: Boxed Files holds material smaller than 9 by 14 inches, Flat Files holds items between 9 by 14 and 24 by 40 inches, and Oversize Files holds material larger than 24 by 40 inches. All series include an immense range of printed material and photographs; snapshots, cyanotypes, news release photos, etchings, engravings, photogravures, lithographs and chromolithographs, albumen prints, silver gelatin prints, cabinet cards, book plates, and second generation copy photography are represented throughout the Subject File.</p>
            <p>The hierarchy is the same throughout the collection, although all categories do not appear in each series. Cross-references are made within the container list when appropriate. Where possible, Library of Congress subject headings and organizational terms have been used. This file is meant to be an open and active file, and will most likely see many new additions. The following description is current only as of December 2002.</p>
            <p>The amount and disparate types of material in this collection preclude an itemized discussion of each subject covered. Below are descriptions of some of the collection's highlights. Most of the notable material in this collection can be found in the PEOPLE subseries, in both Series I and II. Subseries level categories (the "subjects" covered in the collection) are rendered in all capital letters in the text. Further divisions of those categories or folder titles are found in quotes. Due to the complicated structure of the collection, only the subseries level categories are listed here. Researchers are encouraged to consult the box and folder list, which is held at the Department of Prints, Photographs, and Architectural Collections, as well as the text below, for more detailed information about the Subject File.</p>

                    <p>Series I is comprised of material that is smaller than 9 by 14 inches and is housed in document boxes. The material is arranged alphabetically in approximately 50 broad subject areas. Much of the material in this series was donated by George T. Bagoe, who collected, among other things, copy photographs of historical photography, which he mounted on pieces of pulp board and annotated with calligraphied captions.</p>
                    <p>ADVERTISEMENTS includes a set of cabinet cards taken around 1889 by Mrs. G. M. Bowen, a photographer from Waterloo, Iowa. In these photographs women physically advertise local shops and products by wearing dress skirts decorated with the products. For example, a woman with shoe soles pinned to the bottom of her dress is holding a banner advertising UTK Fine Footwear.</p>
                    <p>ANIMALS is mostly comprised of photographs of horses.</p>
                    <p>ART is divided into "Painting" and "Sculpture." "Sculpture" is largely photographs relating to sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward (1830-1910), including two photos of horses posing as models for equestrian statues and other photographs and engravings of Ward's sculptures, all given by the artist's daughter. It also includes a photograph of sculptor John Rogers' studio.</p>
                    <p>ASTRONOMY includes early engravings of telescopes and other devices. Several of these prints were engraved for British newspapers as early as 1748.</p>
                    <p>CLOTHING AND DRESS is divided into chronological periods. Most of this category is fashion plates and pages removed from magazines such as 
                        <title render="italic">Godey's</title> from as early as 1842. Some of these plates are hand-colored, and others are chromolithographed. Two folders are illustrations of French dresses and French fashion plates, dating from 1870-1880.</p>
                    <p>COMMUNICATION DEVICES includes photos and prints of telegraphs, tele-exchange, telephones, phonograph, and a photograph of a large group of women telephone operators.</p>
                    <p>CRIMES includes two photographs of a lynching from 1930.</p>
                    <p>DEMONSTRATIONS consists mainly of news release photographs taken in the early 1970s. Several of these show New York City policemen involved in shutting down a Gay Power demonstration. Several other demonstrations pictured are against the Vietnam War, such as an occupation of the Statue of Liberty by a group of Vietnam Veterans. Several images of a 1970 May Day celebration and counter-demonstration are in the "General" folder. Photos of women's suffrage demonstrations can be found in PEOPLE under "Women."</p>
                    <p>DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATIONS is almost all copy photography of photographs of westward movement throughout the United States, including images from Custer's 1874 expedition to South Dakota. The exception is the material illustrating Commodore Matthew Perry's trip to "open" Japan in 1853-1854. This group includes 34 lithographs from Perry's 
                        <title render="italic">Narrative of the Expedition of an American Squadron to the China seas and Japan</title>, published in 1856.</p>
                    <p>EDUCATION documents primary and high schools, colleges, and universities. Images include a print satirizing a secret society at Yale as well as New York City Department of Higher Education promotional photographs.</p>
                    <p>ENTERTAINMENT-CIRCUSES AND SHOWS includes many contemporary photographs of late 19th and early 20th century circuses. Jumbo the elephant is heavily represented in the folder of "Barnum and Bailey performers." All photos of Hagenbeck's Trained Animal Show are circa 1893.</p>
                    <p>INDUSTRY is divided into construction and printing industries. "Construction Industry" is entirely photographs of buildings under construction by the Turner Construction Company from 1917 through 1958.</p>
                    <p>PEOPLE is mainly comprised of images of the ethnic groups of African Americans and Native Americans. "Afro-Americans" includes a 1910 New York Police Department mugshot of Noah Boyd, photographs of a bar in Harlem in the 1940s, and a cardboard tag in the shape of a man's bust with the message 
                        <title render="italic">End Lynching</title>. Also represented are Civil War-era and later caricatures of African Americans, including many which were photographed and made into cabinet cards. Portraits generally include unidentified men and women, identified portraits are filed by surname in PR 052, the Portrait File. The many images of slavery include an albumen print showing the interior of a slave pen in Alexandria, Virginia, and a French engraving of a slave sale in America. A number of prints cut from newspapers in 1858-9 detail the story of 200 captured slaves who were taken to Liberia on the steam-frigate Niagara. Also included here are group photographs of African American Civil War soldiers and a set of albumen photographs from 1863-1864 of paintings by T. Waterman Wood of African American soldiers titled "The Contraband," "The Recruit," and "The Veteran."</p>
                    <p>"Indians of North America" contains early prints and early photographs, as well as copy photography and published illustrations. Photographs with the same provenance or which are historically notable have been isolated into their own folders. One of these is a series of photographs taken by the U.S. Signal Corps ca. 1890 in the Black Hills of Montana around the time of Custer's battle. A set of cabinet cards issued by the Santa Fe Route train company shows Native Americans of the Southwest, and were probably meant as a tourist advertisement. One folder includes portrait photographs taken by William Henry Jackson for the Bureau of American Ethnology. Cyanotypes are also housed together.</p>
                    <p>Early European prints include a 1756 engraving of "Hendrick the Sachem, or Chief, of the Mohawks" and an 1827 hand-colored lithograph of "Les six Indiens de la tribu des Osages." A portrait of "Philip, King of Mount Hope," (Philip, Sachem of the Wampanoags, of King Philip's War) was engraved by Paul Revere, and is a plate from the 1772 edition of Benjamin Church's 
                        <title render="italic">The Entertaining History of King Philip's War</title>. Portraits of a "Maha Queen" and an "Ottoes Chief" are pages from an 1809 edition of the 
                        <title render="italic">Travels of Capts. Lewis and Clark</title>. Additional early portraits are of "Joseph Thayendanekan, a Mohawk Chief," and of "Mico Chlucco the Long Warrior, Chief of the Seminoles." Any portrait in which a tribe was named has been filed with other images of Native Americans in that tribe. Portraits in which no tribe was mentioned are filed alphabetically. There are many more portraits of Native Americans in the folders of individual artist's works.</p>
                    <p>Prints after the work of early painters of Native Americans are plentiful. Most are hand-colored lithographs. A collection of plates of portraits of Indians after the artist George Catlin was given by Mrs. Ernest C. Kinney, a granddaughter-in-law of Catlin. These are most probably from a circa 1860 American edition of Catlin's 
                        <title render="italic">Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs, and Condition of the North American Indians</title>, and are housed together with a few other prints after Catlin. Scenes engraved after Carl Bodmer, mainly for publication in mid to late 19th century magazines are found throughout this category.</p>
                    <p>Several lithographs are by John T. Bowen. Many of these images were published in Thomas McKenney and James Hall's 
                        <title render="italic">History of the Indian Tribes of North America</title> 1836-1844. One folder contains hand-colored lithographs after James Otto Lewis's paintings of Native Americans. Some of these were lithographed by J. H. Bufford. Another folder contains hand-colored engravings after drawings by Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur (1757-1810). Eight are from Grasset's 
                        <title render="italic">Encyclopedie des Voyages. . .</title>, Paris: 1796. These drawings are all of Iroquois and were engraved by Jean Laroque (active 1730-1775). Other plates from another of Saint-Sauveur's books, all with French captions, are also included. These are possibly from a later edition of his 
                        <title render="italic">Costumes Civils Actuels de Tous les Peuples Connus</title>, first published in 1788. Additional prints by Bowen and after Lewis and Catlin can be found in Series II.</p>
                    <p>The "Women" category of PEOPLE is mainly suffrage-era photography. Many of these photos were used by the New York State Women's Suffrage Party for publicity purposes. Views include parades, voter registrations (some organized by the League of Women Voters), and two women flying an airplane.</p>
                    <p>PRISONS holds photographs taken in 1971 at Attica prison in upstate New York after the Attica prison riots.</p>
                    <p>QUARRYING is comprised completely of photography of the Settlement Quarry in Maine taken in 1922-23.</p>
                    <p>RESERVOIRS includes photography and prints of the Croton Aquaduct and an engraving of the lower Manhattan Water Works in 1825.</p>
                    <p>SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT includes images of trash incinerators, ether, radar machines, and scientific laboratories.</p>
                    <p>STORES AND SHOPS is divided into appliance stores, bakeries, and drug stores. A folder of snapshots and larger photos document the interior and exterior of the Bagoe family drugstore at 29th Street and Fourth Avenue.</p>
                    <p>SPORTS AND RECREATION is foldered by type of activity. "Boxing" includes a cabinet card of Ebert Zink, billed as a "boxing Lilliputian." "Football" includes the program from a Yale-Harvard football game on Nov. 21, 1914. "Golf" includes photographs of women playing the game. "Wrestling" holds a set of cabinet cards that show the different holds and positions of the sport.</p>
                    <p>TRANSPORTATION is divided into groups: "Railroads," "Road Construction," "Tramways," and "Vehicles." "Road Construction" includes pictures of the Bronx Bureau of Highways, mainly showing construction along White Plains Avenue in the Bronx. "Tramways" is a group of color photographs of the Roosevelt Island Tram, taken in the 1970s to 1980s.

                    <p>UNITED STATES HISTORY is mainly historical prints depicting events that are not found in any other category. Several are plates from William A. Crafts' 
                        <title render="italic">Pioneers in the Settlement of America</title> (Estes &amp; Lauriat, 1876). Photographs of the proceedings of the Knapp Commission, investigating corruption in the New York City police force in 1971, are also included.</p>

                    <p>WARS is arranged in chronological order. Scenes from the lives of important characters in any of these wars, for example George Washington in the Revolutionary War, have been filed in the portrait file under that person's surname. "French and Indian War" includes some contemporary engravings cut from British magazines in 1759-1760. "United States Revolution" also includes a few contemporary engravings but is mostly later historical prints. Notable engravings include images of battles and events after paintings by A. Chappel (1850s) or John Trumbull (1844 and later). "War of 1812" includes a copy of the pamphlet, 
                        <title render="italic">Collection of American Victories</title>, illustrated with engravings of paintings by French artists, published in New York in 1840.</p>
                    <p>United States Civil War-era photography was removed from the Subject File and is now its own collection. Civil War material left in this file is comprised of historical prints, both contemporary and later, copy photography, and later photography of battlesites and memorials. "Medical Aspects" includes images of the U. S. Sanitary Commission. "Spanish American War" contains many contemporary photos that were mounted on paperboard. Many of these show an invasion of Cuba. A set of snapshots taken by Capt. Don A. Baxter show an army prison camp at Seavey's Island in Portsmouth N.H. Two copies of 
                        <title render="italic">Our Heroes of the Spanish-American War</title> (New York: Central Bureau of Engraving, 1898), a set of engravings of figures from the war, are included here as well.</p>
                    <p>"World War I" includes many small groups of photos. Many of these are snapshots from training camps or the European theater. A set of German photographs showing German soldiers in action are stamped "Kaiser's Official Photographer." "Jacob's Collection" is two folders of snapshots showing daily life in New York during the war, including parades and rallies. Many of these photographs are captioned and dated. "Underwood and Underwood" are official news photos. All of the "Caricatures &amp; Cartoons" found here were drawn by Bruce Bairnsfather. "Peace" includes images of the signing of the armistice and the victory parades in New York. "World War II" includes ephemera and some copy photography of posters. Official government and other photographs from World War II comprise their own collection, and should be consulted as well.</p>
                    <p>General categories appear in capital letters, and are often broken down into more specific topics, although those topics do not appear in this list. The total numbers of folders for each general category is shown.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                    <p>Series II. Flat files contain material that is larger than 9 by 14 inches, and is housed flat in folders in map case drawers. Material in this series includes chromolithographs, photogravures, photographs, engravings, mezzotints, photomechanical reproductions, sheet music, and newspaper inserts, among other formats.</p>
                    <p>AGRICULTURE includes scenes of farmland and portraits of prize winning bulls.</p>
                    <p>ANIMALS includes images of more domestic animals, as well as a series of engravings of prize horses done for 
                        <title render="italic">The New-York Spirit of the Times</title> newspaper between 1835 and 1837.</p>
                    <p>ALLEGORICAL PRINTS is almost all lithography of patriotic themes.</p>
                    <p>ART is photographs of sculpture, mostly of Rogers groups.</p>
                    <p>ASTRONOMY includes two 17 x 22 inch mounted albumen photographs of the moon. One was taken on March 6, 1865 from New York City by Lewis M. Rutherford, who donated the photo to N-YHS the next year. The other was taken by Dr. Henry Draper in Hastings, New York with a silvered-glass telescope on September 3, 1863.</p>
                    <p>CLOTHING &amp; DRESS includes sheet music for "The New Bloomer Polka," and 
                        <title render="italic">Godey's</title> and 
                        <title render="italic">Frank Leslie's Lady's Magazine</title> fashion plates, Currier &amp; Ives prints of the bloomer fashion and another fashion called "the Grecian Bend." Uniforms included are U. S. Army uniforms, shown in Army-issued historical prints.</p>
                    <p>COMMUNICATION DEVICES contains charts with keys to the telegraph flag system, and prints celebrating the laying and completion of the Atlantic Cable.</p>
                    <p>CRIMES is primarily prints dealing with the 1836 Helen Jewett murder case in New York City.</p>
                    <p>DOCUMENTS include many printed copies of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, as well as the Emancipation Proclamation and other public documents. Many of these are lithographed copies of a calligraphic exercise, in which the text has been altered in scale and pen stroke thickness so as to create images such as portraits within the text. For example, the text of the Emancipation Proclamation has been highlighted in certain ways so that Abraham Lincoln's face is clearly visible in the text. These prints (which include the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States) were all drawn by R. Morris Swander, and were printed in 1865 by P.S. Duval, a Philadelphia lithographer. An original drawing of this sort of treatment of the Constitution of the Confederate States of America shows the faces of Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, and Stonewall Jackson within the text. The drawing may well be by Swander as well.</p>
                    <p>Impressions of the United States Constitution include one printed in the 1830s by C. L. Adams &amp; Son in Boston. A statistical chart showing some results of the 1840 Sixth United States Census was also printed by C. L. Adams in 1844. One of the impressions of the Emancipation Proclamation was designed in 1864 by F. S. Butler, a 14 year old from San Francisco. Another is a vibrant chromolithograph by Max Rosenthal showing Civil War scenes and portraits of Generals. All impressions of that document date from 1864 and 1865.</p>
                    <p>Impressions of the Declaration of Independence date from as early as 1826 and include many after the design of John Binns, with ornamental seals representing the states of the Union and portraits of Washington, Jefferson, and Hancock. Several others were designed by Benjamin Owen Taylor and engraved by Peter Maverick. Many incorporate a vignette after Trumbull's "Declaration of Independence," including a hand-colored lithographed published in 1856 by J. C. Buttre of New York. A rare hand-colored engraving of the document by Humphrey Phelps was published in 1845.An impression published in 1876 celebrates 100 years of American Independence and includes vignettes of scenes from the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia.</p>
                    <p>EDUCATION includes plates numbers 1-5 and 9-12 of Louis Prang's "Trades and Occupations" set of his "Aids for Object Teaching," chromolithographs which he designed for educational use in 1874. Each plate shows a different career. This subseries also includes several oversize alphabet cards.</p>
                    <p>ENTERTAINMENT contains one composite photograph showing every single member of the Ringling Bros. &amp; Barnum &amp; Bailey combined circus that played at Madison Square Garden in 1929.</p>
                    <p>FLAGS is mainly United States national and state flags, some international. Includes a chromolithograph, "A Chart of National Flags" published by J.H. Cotton in New York in 1860.</p>
                    <p>HOLIDAYS includes a hand-colored Currier &amp; Ives print of "Young America Celebrating."</p>
                    <p>INDUSTRY includes machines and photographs of exhibits of industrial skill.</p>
                    <p>INVENTIONS includes specific machines, such as the cotton gin.</p>
                    <p>MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS is primarily photographs of a Squadron A. Many of these photographs take place at a training camp in Sea Girt, New Jersey.</p>
                    <p>PEOPLE is largely prints of Native Americans, with some of African Americans, and a few general prints. These include "The Life &amp; Age of Man," a broadside from ca. 1830 printed in both English and German, and a rare copy of the corresponding "Life &amp; Age of Woman." "Afro-Americans" includes broadsides and prints celebrating the 15th amendment to the Constitution, and several prints showing aspects of the slave trade. A folder of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" material is primarily prints of scenes from the book, most printed in France in 1854.</p>
                    <p>"Indians of North America" includes portraits and scenes of life, photographs, and prints. Any portrait or image of an Indian in which a tribe was named has been filed with others of that tribe. One folder of damaged photos includes a photograph by Edward Curtis. Most of the prints are lithographs by John T. Bowen and lithographs and engravings after the work of early 19th century artists Charles Karl Bodmer, George Catlin, Charles Bird King, and J. O. Lewis, and others. These are foldered by artist.</p>
                    <p>The engravings after Bodmer were published in London in 1839 and later, and seem to be plates from several different editions of 
                        <title render="italic">Travels in the Interior of North America</title>, 1832-1834, the published journals of the Maximilian-Bodmer expedition. This book was published in German, French, English; the plates are captioned all three languages. Most of these engravings are brilliantly hand-colored. The plates measure 13.5 by 21 inches and smaller.</p>
                    <p>Twenty lithographs by John T. Bowen were published by F. W. Greenough in 1836-1838 and 1842. Bowen was a prominent lithographer who produced the lithographs for Audubon's 
                        <title render="italic">Birds of America</title>, among other works. Bowen's illustrations of Native Americans were published in several of McKenney and Hall's popular books about Native Americans. These lithographs, while showing similar portraits to those in the books, appear to have been individually issued. They were "drawn, printed &amp; coloured" at Bowen's lithographic studio in Philadelphia.</p>
                    <p>Works associated with George Catlin include several facsimiles of notes and sketches made by Catlin on his visits with Native Americans, as well as Currier &amp; Ives prints after Catlin's paintings. Also included are two advertisements, one looking for subscribers for Catlin's 
                        <title render="italic">North American Indian Portfolio</title>. The second is an announcement in French of the coming appearance of the "O-jib-be-wa's," members of one of Catlin's European traveling Indian shows. A large portrait of Osceola was lithographed by Catlin himself in 1838, after his painting of the Seminole chief.</p>
                    <p>Several prints commemorate the visit in 1710 of four Iroquois kings to the court of Queen Anne of England. Individual full-length mezzotint portraits of each king by John Simon after paintings by John Verelst and bust-length portraits by Peter Schenck from paintings by John Faber are foldered together.</p>
                    <p>Several portraits were drawn from life by J. O. Lewis between 1825 and 1840 and lithographed by Bufford's Lithography in New York City. In addition, this folder includes a broadside published by Lewis in 1840 with a portrait and life history of Elkswattawa, "The Prophet of Tippecanoe."</p>
                    <p>Nine lithographs were hand-colored by Lehman &amp; Duval after paintings by Charles Bird King, and published by Key &amp; Biddle, 1833-1838. King painted Indian visitors to his studio in Washington, D.C. from 1821 to 1840s. Several hand-colored lithographs were drawn, colored and published by Daniel Rice &amp; James G. Clark in 1842-1843. "Indians of South America" is six colored engravings of Incan costumes from an 1809 French atlas, 
                        <title render="italic">Voyages au Perou Faits Dans les Annees 1790-1794</title>.</p>
                    <p>RELIGION includes prints of different denominations worshipping, especially Shakers. Prints of biblical scenes are also included here.</p>
                    <p>SPORTS AND RECREATION includes prints of horse racing, picnicking, hunting, fishing, and ball playing. Several of the horse racing prints show races held at Jerome Park in the Bronx.</p>
                    <p>TRANSPORTATION is divided into "Railroads" and "Vehicles." "Railroads" is mainly comprised of photographs, some of these are of train engines. Copy photographs show the ceremonies for the laying of the last rail on the transcontinental railroad. "Dewitt Clinton" was the first steam-powered passenger train in New York. It traveled sixteen miles from Albany to Schenectady on the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad line in 1831. "Aircraft" includes a print from circa 1835 showing the "Prince's Aerial Ship. Star of the East!" a fanciful blimp-like structure outfitted like a cruise ship. Aircraft accidents is a folder of photographs showing the 1970 crash of a Trans International Airlines DC-8 plane at Kennedy Airport. "Automobiles" includes photos of early cars, and plates from 
                        <title render="italic">Safety for Twenty Million Automobile Drivers</title>, a how-to-drive manual from 1922. The photographs show a person doing driving maneuvers in New York street scenes. "Carriages &amp; coaches" is a large category that includes both photographs and prints.</p>
                    <p>UNITED STATES HISTORY is mainly historical prints depicting events (apart from wars) that are not found in any other category. The "Colonial Period" folder contains prints of pilgrims and one showing "William Penn's Treaty with the Indians." This category also includes several prints showing "The First Prayer in Congress," September 1774. "1975-1976" includes prints and ephemera related to the 1975 Bicentennial celebrations.</p>
                    <p>WARS is filed in chronological order and includes contemporary prints, commemorative prints, and a few photographs. The bulk of this category is Civil War material. There is only a small amount of material from World Wars I and II. The "Pequot War" folder contains a plate from John Underhill's 1638 book 
                        <title render="italic">Nevves from America</title> showing the layout of an Indian fort.</p>
                    <p>"United States Revolution" includes a set of lithographs published by Strobridge in 1893 showing important events from the war. "War of 1812" includes many contemporary prints, including several French prints commemorating the Treaty of Ghent. Two early American lithographs of the Battle of the Thames, dated 1833 and ca. 1837, are also notable. One of these is hand colored. A contemporary broadside is illustrated with relief woodcuts and advertises 
                        <title render="italic">The First Book of Remarkable Events of the Present American War</title>. Another, similarly illustrated broadside is a prose account of the battle of New Orleans.</p>
                    <p>The "Crimean War" is represented by one contemporary photograph. The albumen print is 7.5 by 9.25 inches on a 12.25 by 15.5 mount, and appears to be part of a French series of photographs of the war. It is hand annotated "Sebastopol," and has a French title 
                        <title render="italic">Tirailleurs Indigens sous les Armes</title>, or Indigenous Riflemen in the Army. The soldiers are wearing Turkish costumes and turbans.</p>
                    <p>"Mexican War" contains an 1847 
                        <title render="italic">Army Portfolio</title> with chromolithographs of scenes of the war after drawings by Captain D. P. Whiting of the 7th Infantry. "Battles and Campaigns" are almost all lithographs by Currier &amp; Ives or Sarony &amp; Major. A few prints appear to have been lithographed in Mexico by Mexican artists. Some of these are titled in English and Spanish. This category also contains two copies of a hand colored map, "Seat of War &amp; Battles," published in 1847 in New York by Ensign &amp; Thayer, with text about notable people and battles in the war.</p>
                    <p>The "United States Civil War" encompasses many types of material. Contemporary photographs were removed, as noted in Series I. "General" folders include sheet music for the "Maryland Guard Galop" and for "U.S. Army Calls - Military Quadrille." Several disbound pages of an album include reproductions of pro-Confederacy cartoons and caricatures and prints of scenes from the war. A broadside detailing the "Comparison of Products, Population, and Resources of the Free and Slave States" was published in Massachusetts in 1861. A diagram for how to knit army mittens, printed by John J. Hinchman &amp; Co., New York.</p>
                    <p>"Afro Americans" includes prints of African American soldiers and a flyer for Newark's celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1906. "Campaigns &amp; Battles" are filed alphabetically and include many chromolithographs published ca. 1888 by Kurz &amp; Allison, as well as Charles Magnus' published views of battle sites around Richmond. "Military Facilities" includes prints showing volunteer refreshment saloons and a Brooklyn Sanitary Fair. "Camps" includes a camp-made paper flag from Camp Wadsworth in Spartenburg, South Carolina.</p>
                    <p>"Military life" includes 4 folders of plates from Edwin Forbes' 
                        <title render="italic">Life Studies of the Great Army</title> (1876), in which he etched forty different scenes, mostly views of soldiers, mainly at rest. "Military personnel" includes composite portraits of Union and Confederate generals and other army officers. Individual portraits of these men may be found in the portrait file.</p>
                    <p>Materials documenting the "Spanish American War" are mainly chromolithographs and published inserts, prints, and pages from 
                        <title render="italic">Leslie's Weekly</title>, 
                        <title render="italic">Harper's Weekly</title>, and 
                        <title render="italic">Collier's Weekly</title> periodicals. A "General" folder includes several of these inserts with American flags printed on them and text urging the recipient to "cut out flag and put in window." Also included is a broadside from 1904 detailing the "Cost of War and Warfare" by Edward Atkinson. Atkinson published several books and pamphlets on this same topic; this broadside may have served as a prospectus for these works. Material is organized by theaters of war. "Phillipines" includes many prints showing the Battle of Manila, and a few of the commemorative Dewey Arch erected in New York City.</p>
                    <p>"World War I" material is also primarily chromolithographs and newspaper inserts. One folder contains front covers of 
                        <title render="italic">Leslie's Weekly</title> from 1917-1918 while the magazine was running its series, "The War in Pictures." These covers are all patriotically illustrated, mainly by James Montgomery Flagg. Photos in this category include several of victory parades in New York.</p>
                    <p>"World War II" contains a few advertisements for wartime saving and other conservation minded appeals. Photographs taken (mainly by the U.S. government) during World War II were removed to PR 076 World War II Photography Collection.</p>
                    <p>General categories appear in capital letters, and are sometimes broken down into more specific topics. This series is housed flat in drawers. The number in the folders column refers to the number of folders for each subject.</p>

A rare sheet shows the Declaration of Independence surrounded by charts of statistical and historical information about the United States, all within an ornamental arch and border. It was published by Humphrey Phelps and Bela Squire in New York in October of 1832. A lithographed "Facsimile of the Emancipation Proclamation" was issued in Chicago in 1863, to be sold for $2 each; the resulting money was to be used for the erection of a permanent home for the sick and disabled soldiers of the Union Army. Lithographed copies of secession ordinances, printed in the 1860s, are from Virginia, Louisiana (printed in English and French) and South Carolina. Notable among other documents included here are a "Declaration of Sentiments, adopted by the Peace Convention, held in Boston, September 18, 19, and 20, 1838;" a hand-colored "Pictorial History of the United States" from 1846, and an illuminated parchment broadside with hand-calligraphy, a gift from the Netherlands Hudson-Fulton Celebration Committee to the New York Hudson-Fulton Celebration Committee, at the time of the 1909 Hudson-Fulton celebration.</p>
