            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>The Sons of Temperance, a total abstinence society, was founded in New York in 1842. The fraternal order provided assistance for its members, both in remaining temperate, and as a mutual aid society. More broadly, they promoted the societal benefit of abstinence and temperance. The Montauk Division, a regional branch of the Sons of Temperance, was founded in Sag Harbor, in 1844.</p>
            <p>In contrast to its immediate predecessor, the Washington Movement, the Sons recruited members from among those already well affected to their cause. Though they refrained from taking public stances on religious and political matters, they did advocate ending the temptation by stopping the production and sale of alcohol.</p>
            <p>As a mutual aid society, the Sons of Temperance doled out sickness and disability benefits and allotted money to assist with the burial of fellow brothers and their wives. The attractiveness of its benefits led the organization to operate as a secret society, with stringent rules and a highly restricted membership. Allegations of intemperance and other transgressions were routinely investigated and often led to expulsion from the organization.</p>
            <p>Though the Sons of Temperance survived through the Civil War, the Montauk Division ceased operation in 1865, replaced by the Agawam Division in 1867.</p>

            <p>The records offer insight into the practical operation of a nineteenth-century fraternal organization. They cover aspects such as finances, the activities of the local division and wider organization, upkeep of the meeting hall, the management of its membership -- including investigations into allegations of transgressions of the group's rules and visitations, and payments to qualifying members. The records are composed of meeting minutes, committee reports, bills and receipts, printed circulars, letters, membership applications, inventories, proposed amendments, records of visitations to sick brothers and investigations of brothers.</p>

                    <p>This folder includes five treasurer's bonds, and one for a trustee. The documents were drafted to indemnify the Montauk Division against financial malfeasance, and stood until the treasurer or trustee had completed their duties and turned over all money and organizational material to their successor.</p>

                    <p>The contents of this series cover the expenses for upkeep of the Sons of Temperance Hall, printing, postage and other expenses associated with the operations of the group. It is not clear whether the last few items directly relate to the Sons of Temperance but do appear to be promissory notes for one of its members.</p>

                    <p>Within this series are documents with little or no context, and in most instances do not appear to have any direct connection to the organization. The items seem to have been from the personal papers of an individual who maintained the Sons of Temperance records. They contain parts of a will, other official documents, poetry, mathematical calculations, and a list of names.</p>
