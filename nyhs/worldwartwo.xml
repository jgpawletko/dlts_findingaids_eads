            <p>The World War II Collection is an "artificial" collection of subject-related materials that were donated by or acquired from a variety of unrelated sources at different times. A group of letters to The New-York Historical Society superintendent Garrett H. Winter from nine empoloyees on active service describe a range of servicemen's war experiences: working as a radar operator in Washington State; guarding prisoners of war in Delaware; serving in India; witnessing surrender in Germany; and hospitalization for "operational fatigue, in other words, nerves."</p>
            <p>Other servicemen's experiences are documented in a letter from "Johnnie" to his mother, describing a Navy search and rescue mission off the coast of Iceland for survivors of a ship sunk by a German submarine. The collection includes accounts and artwork by servicemen through V-mail, or Victory-mail, that was a unique form of microfilmed correspondence used during World War II to screen messages and reduce bulk on cargo ships. Correspondents would write on special V-mail letter-sheets, which were then reviewed by military censors and reduced to thumb-nail size on microfilm. The reels were then sent to receiving stations near the addressee where miniature facsimilies of the original V-mail letter sheets were reproduced and delivered.</p>
            <p>The experiences of British civilians during the German air raids are also documented in this collection. A group of letters by Edward Tempest from Yorkshire, Britain to American friends were circulated in round robin letters--a wartime penpal exchange sponsored by the 
                <emph render="italic">Christian Science Monitor</emph>. Tempest's letters are a vivid portrait of everyday life during the blitz yet were clearly written for a broad public with the purpose of fostering solidarity between British and American civilians.</p>
            <p>War-time deprivations, restrictions, and civilian activities to support the war effort are exemplified in numerous documents. The collection includes a ration book with stamps for coffee and other goods belonging to a 12-year-old boy. It also includes an identification card of a hostess of a Stage Door Canteen. Broadway's wartime service organization, the American Theatre Wing sponsored the popular Stage Door Canteens for the exclusive entertainment of uniformed military personnel. There is also a Civil Service Award by the Navy Department for "outstanding performance and loyalty" to the chief of construction on the docks of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Other items include an exchange of letters regarding the ban on taking photographs in New York Harbor, a war damages insurance policy, and the logistical plan for a 1942 "New York at War" parade in Manhattan.</p>

                    <p>This series consists of nine folders of letters to New-York Historical Society superintendent Garrett H. Winter by employees on active service: William R. Baillie, Ladislaw (Larry) Csierny, James J. Fisher, William Givens, Joseph Gymory, George Johnson, Vincent J. Marshall, Charles J. Miller, and George Takas. These letters describe a variety of wartime experiences from basic training camps in the United States to active combat overseas. New-York Historical Society employees were deployed in different aspects of service: operating radar in Washington State; guarding prisoners of war in Delaware; serving in India; serving in Germany during and after the German surrender. One employee writes from his hospital bed where he is recovering from "operational fatigue, in other words, nerves."</p>
                    <p>The letters indicate that Garrett H. Winter wrote and sent care packages to these employees and that the employees in uniform also wrote to each other. The collection includes only the letters written directly to Garrett H. Winter.</p>

                    <p>Series III includes other correspondence and documents pertaining to military and civilian life during World War II. A highlight in this series is a letter from "Johnnie" to his mother about a Navy search and rescue mission for survivors of a ship that was sunk off the coast of Iceland by a German submarine. The series includes a civilian service award for the director of construction at the Brooklyn Navy Yards, other correspondence (including V-mail), an exchange of letters about the banning of photography in New York Harbor, plans for a "New York at War" parade in Manhattan, a ration book for a 12-year-old boy, a photo ID card for a Stage Door Canteen hostess, and a war damage insurance policy.</p>
