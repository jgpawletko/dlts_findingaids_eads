            <p>Frank Carl Costanzo (1912-1937?) was a waiter and union member from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In early 1937, at 25 years old, Costanzo went to Spain to join the International Brigades, supporting the Loyalist cause in the Spanish Civil War. He hid the information that he had joined the war effort from his parents. After attending officers' training school, where he studied Spanish and military skills, Costanzo joined the staff of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, and went with them into heavy action, fighting on at least four fronts. After spending time in a hospital with a sprained ankle, he returned to the front. Constanzo died in Spain in December 1937 or early 1938. He left behind a wife, Ida S. Costanzo and a son, Stan.</p>

            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series I, Spanish Civil War Letters</emph>. The letters in this collection are almost all from Frank Costanzo to his wife, Ida, and written while Costanzo was in Spain. In them, Costanzo describes his day-to-day life in the battalion, touching upon details of the battalion's fight against fascist forces. In one letter, he writes by candlelight. In another, he writes from a dugout while under attack, with shells dropping very near to him. Responding to Ida's accusation that he had abandoned her, Costanzo tries to explain his reasons for having gone to Spain. In all the letters, Costanzo expresses his deep love for his wife and baby.</p>
