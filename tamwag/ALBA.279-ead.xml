After the Civil War he lived in Chicago and Detroit, where he was an organizer for the United Electrical Workers and a Communist Party activist.

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The collection consists largely of correspondence received by Mates in his capacity as commander of the Bay Area Post of VALB. Along with regular mailings from the VALB national office and notices from the Bay Area Post are newsletters and notices from Spanish Civil War veterans in Canada and in Europe. There is also a small amount of personal correspondence from other U.S. veterans, including Steve Nelson, Robert Reed and Sana Goldblatt. One envelope contains a few original photos and reproductions of photos from 1937-38 in Spain, with a note from ALBA archivist Victor Berch.</p>
