            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">The 1970s and 1980s saw widespread deindustrialization and a worsening political and legal climate for organized labor in the United States. In response to these conditions, and to the perceived inadequacy of union leaders' responses to these challenges, rank and file caucuses arose in many unions and localities. A large role was played by former student activists of the New Left, many of whom had found their way into numerous small and often short-lived communist, socialist, Trotskyist and Maoist organizations. This collection principally consists of printed ephemera from left/rank and file caucuses within U.S. labor unions. There are also materials from some radical political parties that play a leading role in this activity, and from labor organizations they founded, as well as subject files. The bulk of the material is from the 1970s and 1980s. Materials include flyers, leaflets, newsletters, clippings, reports and statements, pres releases, pamphlets, and some correspondence and minutes. Within series I, Processed Materials, the bulk of the rank and file activity represented is within the manufacturing and transportation industries. Labor unions most prominently represented are the United Automobile Workers (aka the International Union, United Automobile, Aircraft, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America), the United Steel Workers of America, the International Longshoremen's and Warhousemen's Union, and the Communications Workers of America.</abstract>
