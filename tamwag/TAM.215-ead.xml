            <p>Sam Brandon joined the Socialist Labor Party (SLP) as a teenager, and became an organizer for its New York section and chair of its NY State Committee. Political differences led to the expulsion in 1927 of the entire Bronx section. Along with other expellees (including his older brother Joseph), he first formed the Socialist Labor Propaganda League, then the Industrial Union League (IUL) in 1928. In 1933 he founded the Industrial Union Party (IUP), and remained its leader, an advocate of the ideas of SLP founder Daniel De Leon, and a critic of the SLP until his death. Brandon also founded RichLoom, a Brooklyn-based textile manufacturing company, whose profits supported his activism.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This unprocessed collection consists of correspondence and typescripts (principally of Sam Brandon), documents, ephemera, clippings, and some proceedings of various De Leonite organizations. Notable are the five linear inches of files the 1920s and 1930s which closely document, most importantly through Brandon’s correspondence, his expulsion from and ongoing disagreements with the SLP, and the founding of the IUL and IUP. There is virtually no material from the years 1940-1969. The bulk (and remainder) of the collection covers the years 1970-1984, and documents Brandon’s leading activities in several short-lived De Leonite political groupings: the Socialist Committee of Correspondence (ca.1969), the Daniel De Leon League (c1970), Socialist Reconstruction (ca.1971), and the Revolutionary Industrial Unionists (ca.1979); his leadership of the reactivated IUP; and his criticism of the SLP. Other correspondents include Joseph Brandon, Louis Lazarus, and Arnold Petersen.</p>
