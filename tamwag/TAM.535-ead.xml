Shaheen also has accumulated nearly 3,000 motion pictures (spanning from late-19th century silent films to contemporary Hollywood productions) and television programs (including comedies, dramas, cartoons, as well as commercials) on DVDs and VHS tapes (now Tamiment collection number Videos 015).</abstract>
