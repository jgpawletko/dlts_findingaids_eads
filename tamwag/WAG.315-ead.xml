            <p>Billy Holden was a field organizer for the United Electrical Workers (UE) in Connecticut in the 1980s, working out of an office in North Haven. He had a keen interest in labor history, especially Connecticut labor history and the history of the UE. He collected UE material from a number of communities in the state and also preserved his own notes and photocopies on topics of interest.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The collection includes union records from UE locals in many Connecticut towns (including Local 205, Bridgeport; Local 209, Westinghouse workers; Local 227, Singer workers; Local 282, Winchester; Local 299, North Haven; and others). Materials include bargaining files, newsletters, flyers, correspondence, mailings and publications of the international union, scripts of radio spots, clippings, photocopies of scholarly articles, typescript histories and Holden's notes on labor history. One folder contains a number of photographs of UE demonstrations in Connecticut in the 1940s. Holden also collected flyers distributed by rival electrical workers' unions, reflecting the bitter political attacks on the union, which was often accused of being Communist-led.
