            <p>This small collection consists of correspondence and union publications (mainly newsletters) from Samuel Meyers's tenure as the president of Local 259 of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), as well as biographical information about Meyers generated after his death. Photographs of Meyers with various political leaders, mostly from the 1960s and 1970s, make up a large portion of the collection. The collection also contains a gavel and two awards given to Meyers.</p>

            <p>Born in Brooklyn, Samuel (Sam) Meyers initially worked for Local 259 of the United Automobile Workers (UAW) as an organizer before becoming president of the union in 1958, a position he held until 1995. Local 259 represents workers at dealerships and repair shops in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, but Meyers was also very active with UAW at the national level. In addition to his union involvement, Meyers was a staunch civil rights advocate and supported many African American political candidates. He died in 2001.</p>
