Hynes. The interviews were produced as part of an oral history project with the New York Irish History Roundtable and document numerous aspects of Irish American studies and the immigrant experience in America, with specific emphasis on New York. Subjects include the interviewees childhoods and family lives, their professional and political activities, and their involvement with various Irish American movements or organizations, including civil rights and hunger strikes in Northern Ireland and providing support to the families of killed or imprisoned IRA soldiers.</abstract>

            <p>This collection consists of 34 interviews conducted by Jane Conlon Muller with three interview subjects: Paul O’Dwyer, Michael Flannery, and Charles J. Hynes. In the 22 interviews with O’Dwyer, he discusses numerous historically significant moments and movements he participated in, including educating African Americans about voting in Mississippi during the 1960s, presiding over the New York City Council, and the 1968 Democratic National Convention. His interviews document many aspects of Irish American studies, immigrant experiences in America, his legal career, and his political experiences, including running for various offices, the development of the McBride Principles, and the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland. The two interviews with Michael Flannery focus on his experiences in Ireland during the War for Independence and the Irish Civil War and his later life in the United States, including the founding of and resigning from Noraid. The interview with Charles J. Hynes concerns his childhood, family, and his involvement in Irish American affairs, beginning with the 1981 hunger strikes in Northern Ireland.</p>

            <p>The interviews in this collection were conducted in 1990 and 1991 by Jane Conlon Muller, an attorney and member of the New York Irish History Roundtable. She first interviewed O'Dwyer, who suggested that she also interview Flannery. At this time, Muller worked in the Kings County DA's office, which was the impetus for interviewing Hynes. Jane Conlon Muller, born in 1942, is the granddaughter of Irish immigrants from counties Donegal, Leitrim and Clare. She holds a bachelors degree from Queens College and a Juris Doctorate from CUNY Law School. After leaving the Kings County DA's office, she opened her own law practice, which specializes in construction law, elder law, wills, trusts and estates as well as real estate.</p>

                    <p>The 22 interviews with O'Dwyer were conducted between February 1990 and May 1991 in his office at the United Nations building in Manhattan. He viewed these oral histories as a sort of continuation of his autobiography, 
                        <emph render="italic">Counsel for the Defense</emph>, which was published in 1979. Although he discusses some of the issues also touched on in his book, such as educating African-Americans about voting in Mississippi during the 1960s, presiding over the New York City Council, and his participation in the 1968 Democratic National Convention, O'Dwyer also discusses his experiences both in Ireland and in America since writing the book.</p>
                    <p>The interviews contain much information relevant to Irish American studies, including insights into the history of Irish immigration and experiences in America especially in New York; the New York St. Patrick's Day parade; and Irish American athletics, radio shows, and newspapers. O'Dwyer recounts his experiences as a politician in the U.S., including running for various offices, the development and success of the McBride Principles, his relationship to the Jewish community in New York, his relationship with New York Senator Daniel Moynihan, and his work with the United Nations. He also discusses his experiences as a lawyer, including his involvement with professional organizations, such as the National Lawyers Guild and the Brehon Law Society and specific cases he worked on, such as the Fort Worth Five and Joe Doherty.</p>
                    <p>O'Dwyer also discusses Ireland - the history of the discontent between Catholics and Protestants in the North, the civil rights movement, the 1981 hunger strikes, Irish travelers, and the development of the O'Dwyer-Cheshire home and O'Dwyer Forestry Foundation.</p>

                    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                    <p>Paul O'Dwyer (1907-1998), born in Lismirrane, Parish of Bohola, County Mayo, Ireland, was a politician and lawyer noted for his dedication to civil rights. Arriving in the U.S. in 1925, O'Dwyer enrolled in St. John's Law School the following year and graduated in 1931. In 1932, he joined the law firm O'Dwyer and Bernstein. He began his career defending pickets against labor-organizing injunctions, opposing the deportation of foreign-born agitators, and defending the rights of unionists to organize. He was a member of the National Lawyers Guild and served as president of the New York chapter in 1947.</p>
                    <p>O'Dwyer gained success in the courtroom, participating in numerous civil rights struggles in America during the second half of the twentieth century. He worked at registration drives for African Americans in Mississippi during the 1960s, defended Communists and Communist sympathizers during the McCarthy era, vigorously protested the Vietnam War, and battled for the foundation of the state of Israel.</p>
                    <p>O'Dwyer participated in politics both by working behind the scenes on other candidates' campaigns and by running his own campaigns. He assisted in John F. Kennedy's 1962 presidential campaign and David Dinkins' 1998 mayoral campaign. O'Dwyer's own campaigns were less successful. Out of a dozen electoral efforts, he lost all but two: the 1963 race for councilman-at-large in Manhattan and the 1973 race for City Council President.</p>
                    <p>O'Dwyer managed to maintain his identity as an Irish nationalist and embrace his role as an Irish American. The quest for a united Ireland remained a high priority and during his frequent visits back to Ireland he met with all sides of the conflict, including the Irish Republican Army, the Ulster Defense Association, and the Irish government. He introduced the McBride Principles to the United States government, which prevent U.S. government agencies from investing in Northern Ireland companies that discriminate against their employees. He transformed his childhood home into the O'Dwyer-Cheshire Home for Disabled Children and Adults and established the O'Dwyer Forestry Foundation, both to fund the Cheshire home in the future, and also in an effort to reforest part of Ireland.</p>
                    <p>In addition to his civil rights work in the U.S., O'Dwyer was involved in many Irish American organizations, including the United Irish Counties Association, the Mayo Men's Patriotic and Benevolent Association, the New York St. Patrick's Day Parade Committee, and the Gaelic Athletic Association. His love for New York City and its history led him to assist in the creation of the Department of Records and Information Services (D.O.R.I.S.) to oversee the Municipal Archives and to become the Manhattan Borough Historian in 1986. He was the founder in 1950 of the philanthropic Irish Institute of New York, Inc.</p>
                    <p>In 1990 O'Dwyer was appointed the New York City Commissioner to the United Nations and Consular Corps. In this capacity he was instrumental in having the Brehon Law Society admitted to the UN as a non-governmental organization.</p>
                    <p>After a series of small strokes, O'Dwyer retired to his home in Goshen, New York where he died on June 12, 1998.</p>

                        <p>[17:44] You took certain precautions that you've mentioned - what was your state of mind at that time when you were down there?</p>
                        <p>[19:11] What office was she running for?</p>
                        <p>[20:28] You constantly refer to 'we,' so you obviously weren't there by yourself. Could you tell us who else was a part of your group?</p>
                        <p>[22:14] She graduated from where?</p>
                        <p>[23:35] Was it just that they [African Americans] were inexperienced in voting or were they also afraid?</p>
                        <p>[24:32] Am I to understand then that you went down at different times during the sixties and for certain lengths of times? 2 weeks? 3 weeks? Longer?</p>
                        <p>[25:52] This was a somewhat organized movement then that you were a part of?</p>

                        <abstract id="ref19" label="Abstract">[00:00 - 10:00] More on Chaffey case and difficulty finding a Mississippi lawyer. O'Dwyer brought an action against the mayor and governor and made them testify in this case to show how corrupt the establishment was and how it was depriving people of their rights.Another case concerning letting an African American woman use the public library where the courts ruled that she was allowed to use it, but no other African Americans could. 
                            <lb/>[10:00 - 20:00] Discusses role of Catholic church in civil rights movement in Mississippi. Conversation with liberal local parish priest and his perspective on the civil rights movement. More on priests in Mississippi and their activities.

Explanation of freedom riders, more about what he was working on while staying with Mrs. King. For the election of the mayor and five councilmen, there were too many African American candidates for the number of positions available, so O'Dwyer had to convince two candidates to drop out so that the African American vote would not be split. One did rather easily, but a local minister was much more difficult to convince.First elected African American mayor in Sunflower (did not happen during that election).</abstract>

                        <p>[08:48] We're just establishing here that Mr. O'Dwyer did not belong to a specific organization at that time. It's just a matter of record.</p>
                        <p>[12:04] Was this priest of a local parish? That was his function? He was a local parish priest?</p>
                        <p>[12:26] And they worked alone - these parish priests?</p>
                        <p>[13:01] Am I correct in assuming when you say that out of the 125 priests in Mississippi 75 of them were from Ireland? Do you know the reason why?</p>
                        <p>[13:34] So they actually then imported the priests from Ireland?</p>
                        <p>[13:57] And were these priests, these Irish priests, were they volunteers to this community?</p>

                        <p>[06:31] Talking about New York, and I know you have a certain fondness in your voice when you speak of New York, and you're originally from Ireland, and we all know how fond you are of Ireland. Would you say that your feelings for both countries are equal?</p>
                        <p>Questions RE: O'Dwyer's feelings about U.S. and Ireland</p>
                        <p>[10:00-20:00] O'Dwyer continues his answer to the question about his feelings towards the U.S. and Ireland. He speaks of how Ireland is still under tyranny and oppression and how he believes the antagonism between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland is not a natural state for either side, but has been developed and fostered as a means of British supremacy.O'Dwyer explains his views on why he did not get reelected as President of the New York City Council. One of the most significant reasons being the development of the women's rights movement.The day after the election, O'Dwyer received a call from David Horowitz, who asked for help because he was being sued by a Hungarian Nazi named Koreh. Horowitz had a small newspaper that supplied news to Jewish communities in the U.S. that were not in the mainstream. Koreh sued Horowitz for libel because the paper reported that Koreh was responsible for killing 100,000 Jews in Transylvania and that he used to ride a white horse and shoot Jews.</p>

He later lied on his application for citizenship about his conviction and became a U.S. citizen. O'Dwyer believes he could not have done this without assistance from some Washington agency.After leaving his post as the President of the City Council, O'Dwyer did not return to work for his old firm O'Dwyer and Bernstien. Instead, he worked for an Italian American organization called CIAO. He introduces another case he was involved with in which a liberal Italian organization was being taken over by another group but gets sidetracked in discussing what has happened with his old law firm. He discusses its focus on medical malpractice since he left and how his family, including his nephew Frank Durkan, and son, Brian O'Dwyer, had taken over the firm.Questions: 
                            <lb/>[10:00 - 20:00] O'Dwyer explains his reasons for not returning to the firm he founded.Then he talks about his friend Charlie Keith, who started as a sailor and ended up a millionaire. He discusses their relationship, Keith's taking over O'Dwyer's campaign for City Council President, and the establishment of the Charles Keith and Carol Miller Foundation. 
                            <lb/>[20:00 - 30:00] O'Dwyer finishes his discussion of Charles Keith, talking more about the foundation, its function, and his role as a trustee.Civil rights movement in Ireland and how the U.S. civil rights movement gave inspiration to the Irish; history of the antagonism between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland; beginning of a story about his meeting with Something for Democracy, a civil rights organization at Queens College that helped start the movement in Northern Ireland.</abstract>

                    <p>The two interviews with Michael Flannery were recorded in January and December 1991 in his home in Jackson Heights, Queens. Flannery focuses mainly on his experiences in Ireland as he recounts his childhood, joining the IRA, serving in the War for Independence and the Civil War, and being imprisoned for two years. Flannery also discusses much of his life in the U.S., including founding and resigning from Noraid, being charged with gunrunning for the IRA, and being Grand Marshal of the St. Patrick's Day Parade.</p>

                    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                    <p>Michael Flannery (1902-1994), a militant Irish nationalist, was born in Knockshegowna, a small village in the North of County Tipperary, Ireland. He spent his early childhood working on his parents' farm and attending school, but by 1916, the year of the Easter Uprising, Flannery left school to join the Irish Volunteers, a nationalist organization that would later become the Irish Republican Army (IRA). During his active duty with the IRA during both the War for Independence (1919-1921) and the Civil War (1922-1923), Flannery patrolled the Irish countryside, ambushing British soldiers. The British eventually captured him and sent him to prison for two years. In 1927, Flannery emigrated to the United States, married, settled in Jackson Heights, Queens, NY and found a job with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.</p>
                    <p>A devout Catholic, Flannery attended Mass every morning at his local church and neither smoked nor drank. His quiet, undemonstrative character and devotion to the Irish nationalist cause brought him respect and admiration in the Irish American community. Flannery's participation in a multitude of organizations including Clan na Gael, American Congress for Irish Freedom, Gaelic Athletic Association, and Irish Action Committee, earned him the following remark from his lawyer, Frank Durkan: "If there was going to be a meeting of six people in the north Bronx in the middle of a snowstorm, the only man you knew would be there was Michael Flannery."</p>
                    <p>As the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland gained momentum in 1969, tensions increased between Catholics and Protestants and the IRA again rose to the forefront of the struggle. Flannery helped to found the Irish Northern Aid Committee (Noraid) in 1970 to raise funds in the United States to support the families of IRA soldiers who were killed or imprisoned in the North. While the British, Irish, and United States governments believed NORAID to be a front for the IRA, Flannery insisted that, while he supported the IRA's tactics, the money raised did not go to buy arms.</p>
                    <p>In 1981, Flannery and four other men were charged with gunrunning for the IRA (
                        <emph render="italic">U.S. vs. Harrison, Falvey, Mullen, Gormley and Flannery</emph>). The FBI accused Flannery of handling the money in the transaction. The counsel defending Flannery and the other men took an aggressive strategy during the trial by putting forth the idea that the defendants believed that they were working for the CIA. Since the CIA has a license to export weapons, they did not believe they were breaking any laws. This tactic put the burden on the prosecution to prove that the CIA was not involved and the jury found all five men innocent. Flannery was the only one of the defendants to testify, and he used that opportunity to deliver an impassioned speech about Irish history and British oppression.</p>
                    <p>Capitalizing on the publicity from the trial, Irish Republicans campaigned to elect Flannery as the Grand Marshal of the New York St. Patrick's Day Parade in 1983. Given Flannery's open support of the IRA and the recent trial, his nomination did not come without controversy. But despite opposition by prominent politicians, community leaders, the Catholic Church and the Irish government, the parade drew a record crowd.</p>
                    <p>In 1989, Noraid altered its focus to acknowledge the Dublin government and incorporate political measures in resolving the conflict. Flannery and other veterans of his generation believed that a focus on political activities would detract from the fundraising aspects and would ultimately compromise the primary function of the organization. After failing to resolve the differences between his personal beliefs and the new direction the organization was taking, Flannery resigned from Noraid in 1986. He joined the Friends of Irish Freedom in 1989, which had the exclusive purpose of raising money for families of IRA prisoners. He continued his support for FOIF and the militant republican cause until his death in 1994.</p>

                        <p>[11:54] So if you had stayed at the monastery that could have changed your whole life?</p>
                        <p>[13:26] Were any boys taken from the monastery?</p>
                        <p>[13:50] Who would actually take them?</p>
                        <p>[14:11] And then what would they do with the boys?</p>
                        <p>[15:45] They would never train the young boys, as in other countries, to become members of their armies or anything?</p>
                        <p>[16:15] Other than the IRA, did you have any other job in Ireland?</p>
                        <p>[16:30] You lived at home then, until that time [when he left Ireland for America] ?</p>
                        <p>[17:19] So you did this [volunteered for IRA] now from the age of about 16 to 25, is that correct?</p>
                        <p>[19:12] You were how old when you first joined?</p>
                        <p>[19:18] 14 during the 1916 rebellion. Then you were well aware of what was going on?</p>
                        <p>[19:53] Why do you feel you wanted this [to join volunteers] so young? Who influenced you to join the volunteers?</p>
                        <p>[20:43] Were there other members of your family that also belong [to the volunteers] ?</p>
                        <p>[21:07] So it was the family thing to do then in your situation?</p>
                        <p>[23:43] So then you were actually paid probably a salary?</p>
                        <p>[24:15] Who fed you?</p>
                        <p>[24:52] Did you travel usually with a companion or with other members or did you travel individually mostly?</p>

                        <p>[28:14] What would you say? You'd say, "I'm a member of the IRA - can you put me up?" Was it that simple?</p>

                        <p>[00:56] That was the year of the Black and Tan War?</p>
                        <p>[06:50] You actually had a location then?</p>
                        <p>[07:00] Can you spell that word, the Dail?</p>
                        <p>[07:43] What is his name [surviving member of the Dail] ?</p>
                        <p>[07:47] And he's in Dublin now?</p>
                        <p>[08:07] How many people were involved in the army, during the time of the treaty, that were opposed?</p>
                        <p>[13:51] You might have other anecdotes that you want to talk about of your days as a member of the IRA? What territory did it bring you to? How far in the country did you travel?</p>
                        <p>[16:56] Where did you get your arms?</p>
                        <p>[17:33] What did you do for your change of clothes?</p>
                        <p>[17:55] So you would go home occasionally to get replenished?</p>
                        <p>[18:24] It wasn't an easy life at all, was it?</p>
                        <p>[18:33] Did you find it exciting?</p>
                        <p>[18:38] Do you think you had to be young to live this kind of life?</p>
                        <p>[20:16] What percentage of men if you know, would have been members of the IRA of the Irish community?</p>
                        <p>[23:39] Would they send you reinforcements if needed?</p>
                        <p>[23:52] Did you have a rank when you left Ireland?</p>
                        <p>[24:28] How many were in a column?</p>
                        <p>[26:07] Do you remember your first raid?</p>
                        <p>[26:55] How old were you?</p>
                        <p>[27:02] So you had trained for a while before you actually did it?</p>
                        <p>[27:53] How did that happen [spending his 19th, 20th and 21st birthdays in prison] ?</p>
                        <p>[27:56] Were you captured in the middle of a raid or an ambush or just you were in the wrong house or the wrong place?</p>
                        <p>[29:45] How did you get captured?</p>

                        <p>[00:49] So are they planning a big celebration for you, for your 90th birthday?</p>
                        <p>[00:57] Do you happen to know where it's going to be held, since it's not a surprise?</p>
                        <p>[01:16] What is the date of your birthday?</p>
                        <p>[02:45] How did you celebrate your feast days?</p>
                        <p>[03:08] So this is a personal thing between you and your wife then to celebrate only your feast days? Do you have other friends who do this also or this is strictly between you and your wife?</p>
                        <p>[03:33] Was this passed down to you?</p>
                        <p>[03:50] Was this just your idea between the two of you or did you get this idea from some sort of family tradition?</p>
                        <p>[05:18] Don't you think that most people feel that celebrating their birthday - it's an event, it's a special occasion, it draws attention to somebody, to an individual, and they're special for that day.</p>
                        <p>[05:53] When you were growing up in Ireland as a young man, was your birthday celebrated in your home? Did your mother and father make a fuss over you?</p>
                        <p>[06:47] But still that made it special, different from any other day?</p>
                        <p>[06:53] Tell us about the time from about 1969 when political changes were taking place in Northern Ireland.</p>
                        <p>[12:38] At what time was this?</p>
                        <p>[14:39] Whose barracks?</p>
                        <p>[19:11] At what time frame did he start this Worker's Party?</p>
                        <p>[19:29] You were living here in this country in 1969. Yet, you were very well informed about exactly what was going on in the North of Ireland.</p>
                        <p>[21:47] There's been a direct line then between you and the IRA in the North of Ireland all this time, and there continues to be?</p>
                        <p>[27:06] When you say divided us...?</p>
                        <p>[28:20] You said that you founded Noraid in this country 20 years ago. Could you tell me exactly when?</p>
                        <p>[28:55] You were active then, the whole time up until 1986. What was your main focus and purpose?</p>
                        <p>[29:59] Could you please explain what the Dail actually is?</p>

                        <p>[02:40] How did you ensure the fact that the money you sent from this country got into the proper hands over in the North?</p>
                        <p>[03:26] And how did you check on that [that the money was going to people who needed help] ?</p>

                        <p>[05:25] So the constant communication was through letters as well as people travelling back and forth informing both sides what was going on. What about telephone contact?</p>

                        <p>[08:50] You're talking about by population?</p>
                        <p>[12:14] Isn't it a fact that there aren't that many Irish politicians put up these days for office?</p>
                        <p>[13:53] What specifically do you feel would be a good method to stop the drug infiltration into the United States?</p>

                        <p>[18:17] When who wanted to borrow money?</p>
                        <p>[18:29] And you lent them money from Noraid?</p>
                        <p>[19:06] How did you do this?</p>
                        <p>[19:32] Were arms going over just from this country?</p>
                        <p>[20:12] What were you actually accused of that brought about this trial?</p>
                        <p>[20:24] When did this trial take place?</p>
                        <p>[20:31] And who brought the charges against you?</p>
                        <p>[20:44] It was a Federal case then? It was the United States Supreme Court? Against you as an individual or against Noraid?</p>
                        <p>[20:56] And who are the individuals that the charges were brought against besides yourself?</p>
                        <p>[21:24] And who did you get to represent you?</p>
                        <p>[26:07] This all came out in that trial?</p>
                        <p>[26:39] Do you recall all of the charges against you?</p>
                        <p>[26:59] Frank Durkan represented you or George Harrison?</p>
                        <p>[27:11] Who did Paul O'Dwyer represent in this case?</p>
                        <p>[27:32] So the charges were sending arms to Ireland? Were there any other charges?</p>

                        <p>[03:36] Would you tell me the exact date of the beginning of this trial?</p>
                        <p>[04:14] Now, you were all acquitted, is that correct? Was there any aftermath or effect that the trial had on you or any of the defendants?</p>

                        <p>[08:51 ] Was it a large courtroom?</p>
                        <p>[08:55] Did the trial get a nickname? Were the five of you called anything in particular?</p>
                        <p>[09:12] Who do you think tagged that name onto you?</p>
                        <p>[09:31] Now that was in 1982. Had you any contact, anything to do with the hunger strikers that had taken place, with their activities that had taken place in 1981. Did you as Noraid or as an individual have anything to do with that?</p>
                        <p>[11:01] Was this done mostly through Noraid?</p>
                        <p>[11:32 ] Are there any other occasions that you can think of that in the 1980s that brought out large groups of Irish people that you were a part of?</p>
                        <p>[12:29] You're saying there was a lot of strength and unity during the hunger strike activities. And then after your trial in 1982 was there any support or any reason? You were still able to in other words able to raise funds.</p>
                        <p>[13:02] Tell me something about that [being grand marshal of St. Patrick's Day Parade] ? How were you elected?</p>
                        <p>[20:15] Did you almost feel like you were on trial again?</p>
                        <p>[20:41] Were you invited for instance to go on any talk shows, radio or tv shows where you actually got paid money during this time? Were you often paid?</p>
                        <p>[21:13] Who did the documentary?</p>
                        <p>[21:54] Could you please spell for me Nenagh where you said the monument was?</p>

                        <p>[25:00] Do you play a part in any of these ambushes?</p>

                        <p>[26:28] Could you please tell me exactly to the best of your memory, what took place in the documentary footage?</p>
                        <p>[28:12] Did you ever find out who these people were that made this documentary?</p>
                        <p>[28:33] You mean cable tv?</p>
                        <p>[28:44] And you never paid any attention then?</p>
                        <p>[28:48] And obviously no one ever thought to give you a copy of this?</p>
                        <p>[29:06] Did you find the documentary complementary?</p>
                        <p>[29:36] Did you find it factual?</p>
                        <p>[30:08] What do you think was the purpose of this documentary?</p>

                        <p>[00:30] Do you recall the date that this documentary was shown on channel 13? This documentary called, 'The Old Man and the Gun?'</p>
                        <p>[02:01] Did anything else ever come from this documentary? Did it affect your life in any other way?</p>
                        <p>[03:03] How often do you go to Ireland?</p>
                        <p>[03:14] Prior to that you did not go back?</p>
                        <p>[04:02] What 64 members were these?</p>
                        <p>[04:49] Where was this hall?</p>
                        <p>[05:37] What year was this? 1929?</p>
                        <p>[05:49] Did you buy from the city?</p>
                        <p>[06:11] Rented by somebody else or rented by you?</p>
                        <p>[06:17] So that was your speakeasy?</p>

                        <p>[07:35] Do you go back to the same area? Or do you tour Ireland? Or do you visit friends and relatives?</p>
                        <p>[08:18] During the Depression, where did you find people who were so needy? Were they members of the Clan na Gael?</p>
                        <p>[08:28] They were allowed then to stay in your clubhouse until they got on their feet and got jobs?</p>
                        <p>[08:44] So you would say that was the Irish network working in those days?</p>
                        <p>[09:01] You made a statement that you planned to go back to Ireland although you thought that you wouldn't be very welcome. Under what circumstances did you leave Ireland?</p>
                        <p>[09:52] You did leave voluntarily then?</p>
                        <p>[10:27] Did you come by ship under your own name?</p>
                        <p>[10:56] There was no ambassador to Ireland at that time?</p>
                        <p>[11:07] When was the first ambassador to Ireland, do you recall?</p>
                        <p>[14:12] How long did this exist before they all found employment and were well enough to leave?</p>
                        <p>[15:04] Did you ever have others join? What kept it at that number [64 members] ?</p>
                        <p>[15:17] Then what happened to the Clan na Gael and the clubhouse?</p>
                        <p>[15:26] Running the dances still? And where did the profits go?</p>
                        <p>[15:47] Until what year were you still in existence there?</p>
                        <p>[17:05] Did you own the building at that time or were you still renting?</p>
                        <p>[17:21] Were you the president of the Clan na Gael?</p>
                        <p>[17:53] What else was going on in your life in 1984, 1985, 1986?</p>
                        <p>[19:06] Did the government pay you as a foreign agent?</p>
                        <p>[23:59] Did they then cease their propaganda?</p>
                        <p>[24:30] So now we're at the middle of the 1980's. Is there anything else that you can think of that you want to share?</p>
                        <p>[25:03] You mean the division amongst themselves?</p>
                        <p>[27:26] What do you think the main reason is that we're not united?</p>
                        <p>[29:20] The reason that they're coming in great numbers again is because there are no jobs in Ireland?</p>

                        <p>[02:37] When you were first captured, you obviously had to go through an interrogation?</p>
                        <p>[03:31] Did you give a false name?</p>
                        <p>[04:31] In other words, you would speak to somebody in prison and you would be introduced to him and you wouldn't even know he had a false name, is that what you're saying? That's how quiet everybody was?</p>
                        <p>[05:15] I guess you were afraid too that they were spies, was that part of it or not?</p>
                        <p>[05:27 ] Did you have certain codes or certain words that you'd use with each other so that you'd know that you were all part of the IRA?</p>
                        <p>[06:06] What were you charged with when you were captured?</p>
                        <p>[06:51] Were you represented by counsel?</p>
                        <p>[07:30] Were the churches a place of safety when you were on the run?</p>
                        <p>[09:00] Did the church ever give you a haven when you were on the run?</p>
                        <p>[10:13] I guess you didn't get much sleep in those days?</p>
                        <p>[10:29] You were interrogated in the first jail, the local jail, then you were brought to another jail you said. Was that a county jail? How did that work?</p>
                        <p>[12:06] So it was four feet of stone and dirt?</p>
                        <p>[13:24] Did anyone escape through this tunnel?</p>
                        <p>[15:40] How long did it take to build the tunnel?</p>
                        <p>[15:48] And you found out about it afterward?</p>

                        <p>[20:58] This was the same night that the tunnel was going to be finished?</p>
                        <p>[22:50] But you stayed in the same cell?</p>
                        <p>[25:56] Were you beaten?</p>

                    <p>Charles J. Hynes (1935- ) was born in Brooklyn. As a second-generation Irish American, Hynes first remembers developing his Irish identity from the stories that his grandfather would tell him about emigrating to Boston and the discrimination against the Irish that he witnessed. Although a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians since the early 1970s, Hynes only became publicly active in Irish American activities during the 1981 hunger strikes. His outrage at how the British government treated the hunger strikers led him to join in the protests at the British Embassy and eventually to co-found Irish Solidarity Day.</p>
                    <p>Hynes graduated from St. John's University Law School in 1961. He began his public service career as an associate attorney with the Brooklyn Legal Aid society. He later became a special state prosecutor in 1985, where he remained until he was elected as the Brooklyn District Attorney in 1989. Hynes has run two unsuccessful primary campaigns for other elected positions: the 1994 race for state attorney general and the 1998 race for governor of New York. He has also taught as an adjunct professor at St. John's Law School, Brooklyn Law School, and Fordham Law School.</p>

                        <p>[00:20] May I ask you where were you born?</p>
                        <p>[00:26] And your grandparents' names?</p>
                        <p>[01:02] Where were your grandparents born?</p>
                        <p>[01:17] Even though you didn't have anything to do with your paternal grandparents, they were both born in Ireland?</p>
                        <p>[01:34] When did your grandparents come to the United States and if you know, how?</p>
                        <p>[01:55] Do you know why they came?</p>
                        <p>[02:13 ] Do you know with whom they came?</p>
                        <p>[02:35] Do you know what level of education they had?</p>

                        <p>[03:21] And now where was your father born?</p>
                        <p>[03:28] Where was your mother born?</p>
                        <p>[03:34] What level of education did your father have?</p>
                        <p>[03:45] And how did your father make a living?</p>

                        <p>[03:54] And how many children?</p>
                        <p>[04:01] And where were you born?</p>
                        <p>[04:07] And you were raised…?</p>
                        <p>[04:12] What is your first recollection of knowing that you were Irish?</p>
                        <p>[05:01] Was there any other Irish influence in your life?</p>
                        <p>[05:09] Your parents then didn't belong to any Irish American organizations when you were young growing up?</p>
                        <p>[05:26] Tell us a little about your military experience.</p>
                        <p>[05:44] You said there was no Irish neighborhood experiences growing up?</p>
                        <p>[06:01] And what about your religious background?</p>
                        <p>[06:10] And you married a woman by the name of…?</p>
                        <p>[06:34] And now your children, you have…? And has this Irish influence trickled down to them through the stories that you've told them or Irish involvement that you're in - tell me a little bit about it.</p>
                        <p>[07:30] What is the first daughter's name?</p>
                        <p>[07:44] Did you ever have a time when you felt you had to defend it [being Irish] growing up? Do you recall when you yourself got active in your Irishness?</p>
                        <p>[09:09] What was the focus, merely to protest the hunger strike?</p>
                        <p>[09:44] What prompted you to get active and to form this?</p>
                        <p>[10:19] Then where did you go from there with your Irish involvement?</p>
                        <p>[11:49] Do you think that there's something inside you that draws you to do this that maybe wouldn't be in the being of another political leader that might not be of Irish background, or do you think it's involved with your legal knowledge and professionalism?</p>
                        <p>[13:24] Are there other Irish causes that you've been called on to speak out about in recent times?</p>
                        <p>[13:52] What about the Joe Doherty situation?</p>
                        <p>[14:18] Is there any other Irish-type involvement that you're currently involved in or you just do what comes up when it's necessary?</p>
                        <p>[14:33 ] Is there any time in your life or your career where you have felt that someone was prejudiced against you just because you are Irish?</p>
                        <p>[15:42] How did you feel?</p>
                        <p>[16:38] Do you feel that the Irish have been tagged incorrectly as drunks? What do you think is the reason that they've been so tagged?</p>
