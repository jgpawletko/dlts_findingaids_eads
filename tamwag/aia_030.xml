                        <p>Hilary Beirne was interviewed on the 26th of October, 2009 at the Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by James Herron and Linda Dowling Almeida. The topics discussed were wide and varied, starting with his background, growing up in County Roscommon, Ireland and following through his life from college days to working in Ireland in the 1970s and ‘80s to immigrating to the United States in the late ‘80s and ending with his distinguished work with the St. Patrick’s Day Parade.</p>
                        <p>Beirne discusses his early life, growing up with nine brothers and sisters in a large farmhouse that his father, a veterinary surgeon, purchased around the time Beirne was born. He talks about his experiences in National School, and the effects that the small learning community, corporal punishment, and religious doctrine had on his education. He went to secondary school, earning high enough marks to attend college and earn a degree in agricultural studies. He discusses his first few jobs in Ireland, where he worked on projects that redesigned the way Irish farms operate and store various crops.</p>
                        <p>He eventually left his job and immigrated to the U.S. to become a science teacher in the Bronx. It was at this time that he became involved in the New York City St. Patrick’s Day Parade, upon which a large portion of this interview is based. Beirne discusses the finances, the history, the operations and the future of the parade in great detail. He provides an excellent behind-the-scenes view of the production of one of the largest parades in the world. Beirne also discusses, in great detail, the various other Irish fraternal clubs of which he is a member.</p>
                        <p>As a teacher, Beirne discusses his instructing methods and how he engages the student. He also spends time discussing how he became a teacher and the reasons why. He also talks about what he thinks makes a good teacher, and the necessary traits to perform the job well.</p>
                        <p>He then returns to a broader discussion on why Irish-American heritage is important to this country, stating, “40 million Americans trace their heritage back to Ireland…” in order to show just how important the parade is.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the interview, Beirne takes breaks from discussing his life and the parade to talk about his family. He discusses his twin brother and the unique skills he possesses that his twin does not and vice versa. He discusses the odd relationship his siblings (2 brothers, 7 sisters) had with his parents, specifically, the love and strong bond they all had with their mother and poor relationship they had with their father. He also talks about the day he left Ireland and the effects his leaving had on his mother.</p>
                        <p>This oral history was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 2 hours and 28 minutes long, on 3 CDs. The interview took place on October 29, 2009, and the interviewers were James Herron and Linda Dowling Almedia.</p>

                        <p>Hilary Beirne was born on the 6th of January, 1961 and grew up in Ireland between Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon on the Roscommon-Leitrim border. Hilary is an identical twin and one of ten children of the late John Beirne, veterinary surgeon, from Cortober, Carrick-on-Shannon and the late Ethel (nee Regan) Beirne from Coothall, Boyle County, Roscommon. He is married to Marguerite (nee Carvajal) Beirne, the acting Chief Information Officer of Westchester County, New York, and they have one son Connor and reside in Larchmont, New York. Hilary attended Hollymount National School, a state-financed, Catholic-run school, and St. Mary’s College Boyle before going to University College Dublin where he obtained a Bachelor’s Degree in Agricultural Science in 1984. Hilary attended the Franciscan Agricultural College in Mountbellew, County Galway where he was a member of the All Ireland Inter Agricultural College winning team in 1981 and obtained a diploma in Agriculture. In 1990 he obtained a fellowship from the United States Department of Health to study Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at Hunter College of the City University of New York and in 1994 graduated summa cum laude with a Master of Science in Environmental &amp; Occupational Health Sciences and was awarded "Research Thesis of the Year" among other academic achievements.</p>
                        <p>After graduating from University College Dublin in 1984, Hilary worked for three years with O’Hare Animal Feeds in Dundalk, County Louth as a sales representative and an agricultural advisor to farmers in County Louth, Meath and North Dublin. Before leaving Ireland, Hilary also worked for Volac Feeds, Ltd. as its area manager responsible for the west of Ireland. While employed by Volac, he worked with members of the Irish agricultural advisory service, An Teagasc, introducing a technique called the "Wrapping of Bailed Silage," an innovation that changed farming in the west of Ireland.</p>
                        <p>Hilary immigrated to New York in 1988 and became a science teacher and subsequently the Science Department Chair at Monsignor Scanlon High School in the Bronx. Hilary presently teaches science at Eastchester High School in Westchester County, New York.</p>
                        <p>Hilary is a member of the Gaelic American Club of Fairfield County in Connecticut and currently is the Vice President of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Division Nine (The AOH is an Irish-Catholic fraternal organization dedicated to preserving Irish-Catholic rights). Hilary served as Financial Secretary, Recording Secretary, and delegate to the New York County Board and the St. Patrick’s Day Parade. Hilary is also member of the County Roscommon Society of New York.</p>
                        <p>Hilary is a well-known, well-respected leader within the Irish American community of New York City for his work over the past twenty years with the St. Patrick’s Day Parade Committee. He is the nephew of the late Frank Beirne, Past Parade Chairman and Past President of the Leitrim Society. He is one of the elected officers of New York City’s St Patrick’s Day Parade Committee, and serves as the Parade’s Executive, Corresponding Secretary, and Web Master. He is a driving force within the New York City’s St Patrick’s Day Parade and is responsible for bringing the parade into the modern technological era. He is involved in all aspects of the parade, ensuring the operations of the parade on March 17th every year run smoothly.</p>
                        <p>Hilary was only two weeks in New York when the late Frank Beirne asked him to work the reviewing stand and arsenal yard, a job he did every St. Patrick’s Day for approximately six years. Hilary then worked on the Line of March for ten years, five as co-chairman and for the past five years he has served as the Chairman of the Parade’s Formation area. As the chairman he is responsible for giving the signal that starts the parade. Hilary is also the Chairman of the Grand Marshal and Aides Reception, and produces many of the parade’s publications and public relations material. He is the designer of the parade’s web site. In addition to photographs, line of march, parade route and facts about the parade, Hilary has worked with WNBC-TV (New York) to web stream the parade over the internet, and will help produce the television broadcast.</p>

                        <p>In this interview, Sgt. Burns discusses a range of topics, from his family's history in New York City to his own role in the New York community. Sgt Burns spends most of the interview discussing his heritage and his family history, which is an interest of his. He describes his attempts to trace his ancestry to Ireland through his paternal family, the Burns, which leads him to County Cork. His maternal family, the Fitzgeralds, led him to County Galway. Then he describes his family's place in New York, where they lived and worked.</p>
                        <p>Burns remembers his mother, Josephine Marie Fitzgerald, born to Eddie Fitzgerald and Anna Erika Octavia Johanson. The Fitzgeralds he has traced back to County Galway, Ireland, but his grandmother, whom the family called Grandma Svenska, was from Sweden. Burns also discusses the Burns side of the family. His great-grandfather was the first to emigrate from Ireland and he believes the family is from Cork. Neither of Sgt. Burns' grandmothers were Irish. His paternal grandmother was Mary Gale, a an immigrant, believed to be French German. Burns discusses speculation and 'Burns legend' about her emigration but he admits that very little is actually known about it. The speculation is that she was at some point in her youth orphaned and migrated to Pittsburgh. What is definite, Burns discovered, is that Mary Gale and Andrew Burns were living in the same Hell's Kitchen (a famously Irish area on Manhattan's West Side) boarding house, according to the 1900 census.</p>
                        <p>Burns discusses his paternal grandfather, Andrew Burns, at length. He recalls Pop Burns, as he called him, fondly, often calling him quite a character. He tells stories about Pop Burns' business, hauling vinegar for Fleischmann's in New York. He talks about their summers in Rockaway Beach and stories about his Pop's swimming prowess. Burns discusses Pop growing up in Hell's Kitchen and their style of dress. He also talks about Pop Burns and his friends raising pit bulls on the roof tops and his grandfather's choice to not drink, referring to him as a teetotaler.</p>
                        <p>Burns also fondly discusses his mother, Josephine Marie Fitzgerald, who grew up in the Yorkville section of Manhattan's Upper East Side. As a young woman she worked as a secretary at Bonwit Teller, an upscale New York City department store, now closed. Burns remarks about his mother's exceptionally small feet, that were the same size as all the sample shoes delivered to the department store. One of the perks of her job was taking home the sample pairs she liked. He observed that his mother always had the most stylish footwear in the neighborhood. Burns also discusses a story, that he could never verify, that his mother played the piano at Carnegie Hall for a school performance while attending Dominican Academy on Manhattan's Upper East Side.</p>
                        <p>Burns speaks about his different career choices, including six years in the Army Reserves. Then he discusses his tenure with the New York Police Department (NYPD). He recalls his entry into the police academy on 20 June 1966 and being out on the street to keep the peace during riots in Harlem two weeks later on 4 July 1966. Burns spent 27 years working for the NYPD in various aspects. He remained at the 25th precinct in Harlem until 1970. Burns then became a plain clothes officer working for public morals, a division of the NYPD that deals with liquor, gambling, and prostitution violations. Burns was transferred to Glendale, Queens, for two years which he describes as the most boring part of his police career. While Burns was investigating recruits the NYPD came out with their Law Enforcement Assistance Program. Burns took advantage of the program and completed a degree in Criminal Justice at Saint John's University, resuming a college career that he quit to join the Army Reserves. During this time Burns was also studying to be a sergeant and working full time. As a sergeant with the NYPD he began working at the Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Public Information (DCPI) where Burns was the voice of the NYPD. Burns discusses how this change in his police career impacted hi life after the NYPD. Burns released official NYPD statements to the press. It was here that he became interested in the public relations business. He decided to go back to school and received his masters degree with honors from New York University in Media Ecology in 1979 or 1980. Five years later Sgt. Burns became an adjunct professor at NYU in the same program, while still working with the DCPI. Following his police career Sgt. Burns successfully opened two public relations firms. Burns also took an active role in helping his children with their careers.</p>
                        <p>Sgt. Burn's children are a main focus of the interview. He initially lived in Astoria, Queens, with his wife and young family but moved to Valley Stream, Long Island, where he raised his family. Burns eldest child, Mary, attended the Fashion Institute of Technology and lives on Long Island. His two sons Edward and Brian, whom he calls Irish twins because they were born so close to one another in the tradition of many Catholic Irish families, are both involved in the film and television industry. Edward is a writer/director/actor for various films, including the movie that began his career, 
                            <emph render="italic">The Brothers McMullen</emph>, which won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 1995. Burns talks with pride about his son's accomplishments. Brian is also a writer/producer for various programs including the hit HBO television show, 
                            <emph render="italic">Entourage</emph>. Sgt. Burns discussed at length his views on parenting and education.</p>
                        <p>Sgt Burns also discusses his involvement in a group called the First Friday Club - the name alludes to a Catholic practice of attending mass for the first Friday of nine consecutive months to receive a special blessing. This group drew New York Irish American writers, politicians and intellectuals and would meet for lunch at Eamonn Doran's. Sgt. Burns describes the lunch as a meeting of friends that sometimes lasted from noon to six or seven at night. Writers like Frank and Malachy McCourt, William Kennedy, and Terry Moran were in regular attendance. Sgt. Burns describes this group as a small gathering of 10 to 12 that grew into a much larger gathering of thirty or more with the rising celebrity of members like Frank McCourt and his son Edward.</p>
                        <p>Sergeant Edward Burns was interviewed on 14 November 2008 at the Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Emily Mahoney and Professor Linda Dowling Almeida. Sgt. Burns' oral history interview was digitally recorded on a Marantz CD420. The interview is one hour, 57 minutes and 54 seconds long, recorded on two CDs, and has been logged in ten minute intervals.</p>

                        <p>Burns was born in Woodside, Queens, but grew up in Valley Stream, Long Island, which he affectionately calls “the burbs,” referring to the area as a suburb of New York City. He discusses his experience as a young Irish Catholic and his impressions and memories of a suburban childhood. Particularly interesting are his childhood revelations of being Irish.</p>
                        <p>Burns describes the family history, as he knows it, of his mother and father. He details his mother’s childhood, as the daughter of Irish immigrants, growing up without a mother and a father who worked as a sandhog and who was often absent. He believes that his father’s family emigrated from Ireland during the potato famine. Burns traces the professions of his various paternal relatives, including a great-grandfather who owned a horse and carriage trucking company on the west side of Manhattan.</p>
                        <p>Burns explains the process of making 
                            <emph render="italic">The Brothers McMullen</emph> and the various challenges that he faced in shooting the film on a low budget. He tells a few stories of the more unique things he had to do to get “the shot”, including sneaking into a graveyard.</p>
                        <p>Burns took 
                            <emph render="italic">The Brothers McMullen</emph> to the Sundance Film Festival in 1995. Burns’ retelling of his acceptance to Sundance is particularly interesting and at the end of his story, Burns notes “Print the legend.” 
                            <emph render="italic">The Brothers McMullen</emph> won the Grand Jury Prize, which is the equivalent of the Oscar for Best Picture. Burns relates his memories of winning the actual award and all the strangeness that he felt in the moments after the announcement, including a possible embrace with “Sam Jackson”, the actor Samuel L. Jackson to the rest of us.</p>
                        <p>Burns also discusses the roles of the Irish in entertainment and how they are portrayed in movies and television. Remarking about the Irish content and references in 
                            <emph render="italic">The Brothers McMullen</emph>, “none of this has been in a film, so I’m going to put all of it in” almost to the point of going overboard. He also discusses prominent Irish authors whose work he enjoys. Burns explains that he has attempted to adapt a couple of Irish-American novels into films, but to date none have worked.</p>
                        <p>Burns continues to discuss the portrayal of Irish Americans on film and television. He notes that most of the Irish-American characters on film and television tend to be police officers, fire fighters or other stereotypically Irish professions. What Burns says had not been portrayed before was an Irish-American family and their everyday existence.</p>
                        <p>Burns discusses his family’s drive for the next generation to leave the New York suburbs and return to Manhattan, which Burns has done. Burns’ father pushed Burns and his brother to attend college and to pursue the American dream of “doing better” than the previous generation. Burns juxtaposes this ambition with the fact that none of the parents of his friends in Valley Stream had gone to college. He draws the analogy of his own social climbing to the old saying “When your grandfather came here there were signs that said ‘No Irish Need Apply’ and in 1963 we put JFK in the White House.”</p>
                        <p>Near the conclusion of the interview, Burns defines what his perception of Irish American is and what it means to him.</p>
                        <p>Edward Burns was interviewed on October 30, 2007 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Callan Stout, Linda Dowling Almeida, and Joe Ready. This oral history was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 1 hour and 25 minutes long, recorded on two CDs and has been broken into tracks of ten-minute segments.</p>

                        <p>Edward Burns (b. Woodside, Queens, January 28, 1968). The second child of Edward J. and Molly Burns. He has an older sister Mary, and a younger brother, Brian. They lived in Woodside, Queens and then moved to Valley Stream, Long Island, when Burns was three. He attended St. Joseph’s grammar school and was also confirmed and made first communion at the parish church.</p>
                        <p>Burns attended the prestigious Chaminade Catholic High School in Mineola, Long Island, but only for two years. Chaminade is run by Marianist priests and brothers, whose strict discipline and form of teaching sparked Burns’ decision to transfer to public school. Burns attended Hewlett High School and graduated in 1986. When he left Chaminade, Burns also decided to stop attending services at St. Joseph’s Church and has remained a non-practicing Catholic.</p>
                        <p>After high school Burns attended State University of New York at Oneonta for a single semester before transferring to the State University of New York at Albany. At SUNY Albany, following the guidance of his advisor, Burns enrolled in his first film appreciation class. The class was titled “Four Directors” and looked at the work of John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles and Billy Wilder. After that class Burns decided that he wanted to study filmmaking and writing screenplays. SUNY Albany did not offer any classes in film other than film appreciation, prompting Burns to transfer to Hunter College in Manhattan. He studied at Hunter for three years, leaving just nine credits short of graduating.</p>
                        <p>Burns’ first job after leaving college was as a production assistant on the Oliver Stone film, 
                            <emph render="italic">The Doors</emph>. Next he worked as a gofer on 
                            <emph render="italic">Entertainment Tonight</emph> and started working on his first film, 
                            <emph render="italic">The Brothers McMullen</emph>. 
                            <emph render="italic">The Brothers McMullen</emph> was shot on weekends over an eight-month period. The budget has been reported as varying between $15,000 and $35,000, although Burns himself maintains his budget was $25,000. All of the actors and crew worked for deferred salaries; Burns even convinced the film-processing lab to take a deferred payment. Burns also selected locations that were available to him free through friends or stealth.</p>
                        <p>The film premiered at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival in Utah and won the Grand Jury Prize. Robert Redford heads Sundance, and Burns had slipped the film to Redford during an appearance at 
                            <emph render="italic">Entertainment Tonight</emph>. At the urging of a friend Burns also submitted the film for the festival despite what he thought at the time was a steep entry fee.</p>
                        <p>Following the success at Sundance, Burns made 
                            <emph render="italic">She’s the One</emph> with a budget of three million dollars from 20th Century Fox. The film was released in 1996. Robert Redford served as executive producer of the film, which helped Burns retain creative control over the film, because the studio trusted Redford. Burns’ third film, 
                            <emph render="italic">No Looking Back</emph> was released in 1998. This was his most expensive movie to date, totaling five million dollars. The film did not fare well at the box office and recommitted Burns to producing low budget dialogue-driven independent pictures. Burns decided that in order to maintain artistic control of his films he needed to remain self-financed. In order to generate the necessary capital for his next endeavor, he accepted a role in the movie 
                            <emph render="italic">Saving Private Ryan</emph>, his acting debut in a film that he had neither written nor directed.</p>
                        <p>In April 2000, Burns bought John F. Kennedy, Jr.’s former loft in TriBeCa for $2.5 million after John F Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette died in a plane crash off Martha’s Vineyard in July 1999. Burns’ next film, 
                            <emph render="italic">Sidewalks of New York</emph>, premiered on November 15th, 2001 as a benefit for the New York Police &amp; Fire Widows’ &amp; Children’s Benefit Fund. Other benefit screenings were held in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle, San Diego, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. The screening in Washington, DC benefited The Pentagon Victims Fund.</p>
                        <p>In 2002, Burns released the film, 
                            <emph render="italic">Ash Wednesday</emph>. The film performed badly at the box office, which Burns attributes to multiple poor and rapid decisions regarding pre-production and casting. The threat of a strike also rushed him into production, when he was not completely satisfied with the script, to avoid the possibility of strike walkouts during filming.</p>
                        <p>On 7 June 2003, Burns married long time girlfriend, supermodel Christy Turlington. On October 25th of that same year their daughter, Grace McKenna, was born.</p>
                        <p>Burns released 
                            <emph render="italic">Looking for Kitty</emph> in 2004. Burns was inspired by Spielberg’s use of handheld cameras and speed of shooting on 
                            <emph render="italic">Saving Private Ryan</emph> and applied the same techniques to 
                            <emph render="italic">Looking for Kitty</emph>. He shot the film completely on a handheld camera and most of the dialogue was improvised. Burns then went on to act in the films 
                            <emph render="italic">The River King</emph>, 
                            <emph render="italic">A Sound of Thunder</emph>, and 
                            <emph render="italic">The Holiday</emph>. The next film Burns wrote and directed was 
                            <emph render="italic">The Groomsmen</emph>, released in 2006. In this film he returns to his roots and focuses the story on a set of friends on Long Island and how the impending marriage of one of them affects their relationships. In January 2006, Burns and Turlington had a son, Finn.</p>
                        <p>Burns’ most recent film, 
                            <emph render="italic">Purple Violets</emph>, was released on 5 November 2007 solely over iTunes. It is the first film to have its initial release over the Internet. The decision to take this distribution route was influenced by the overall decrease in attendance at movie houses and the rising popularity of alternative viewing opportunities, like iTunes and Netflix. As this is a new distribution model, Burns has the chance to set a precedent for releasing films first across the Internet.</p>

                        <p>Danny Cassidy (1943-2008), musician, screen writer, labor activist, teacher and author, was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of a Navy Chief Petty Officer. His mother Doris Frances, whose ancestors were Famine emigrants, was raised in Brooklyn’s Irish Town near the Navy Yard, and worked at AT&amp;T throughout the Depression and beyond. A graduate of the New York Military Academy, which he attended on a full scholarship, Cassidy continued his formal education at Cornell University, where he studied English literature and creative writing. An avid musician from a young age, Cassidy combined his musical pursuits with writing screenplays, film scripts and treatments. In the early 1960s Cassidy worked at the 
                            <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> and around this time became active in issues related to Civil Rights in the United States and in Northern Ireland. After a stint as a merchant marine during the Vietnam War, Cassidy returned to New York before moving to California with fellow Little David Records recording artists Kenny Rankin and George Carlin. In 1972, Cassidy recorded the album Dan Cassidy (Little David Records). Settling ultimately in San Francisco, where he met and married Clare McIntyre in 1983, Cassidy gravitated from film writing to labor organizing to teaching. In 1995, he founded and co-directed the Irish Studies program at New College of California (which closed in 2008 due to financial problems), where he also directed the school’s Media and Film Studies program. Drawing on his New York childhood, his own family background, and his literary and musical expertise Cassidy was inspired to explore the Irish language influence in American vernacular, which resulted in 
                            <emph render="italic">How the Irish Invented Slang</emph> (Petrolia, CA: Counterpunch, 2007). After a battle with pancreatic cancer, Cassidy died October 11, 2008.</p>

                        <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
                        <p>In this oral history Cassidy, author and scholar, traces the link between his family history his involvement in Irish Studies, and the origins of his research which culminated in How the Irish Invented Slang. In a largely chronological manner, Cassidy starts by discussing his Brooklyn roots; his parents; his education; Vietnam; his battle with drugs and twenty-three month stay at Phoenix House; friendships with comedian George Carlin and musician Kenny Rankin; and the meaning of Irish identity. After starting off with a clear New York/East Coast focus, the narrative then shifts geographically to Cassidy’s life in California and most particularly in San Francisco. Topics like his writing (his screenplay, 
                            <emph render="italic">The Volunteer</emph>, was sold to Francis Ford Coppola), labor organizing, and his move into teaching are covered. Cassidy engages in a detailed discussion of language and slang, in the context of Irish American culture, with his long-time friend Peter Quinn, author of 
                            <emph render="italic">Banished Children of Eve</emph>. Cassidy provides an insider’s perspective on the day JFK was assassinated as a rookie journalist in the newsroom of the 
                            <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>. The interview concludes with Cassidy emphasizing the extent to which Irish American scholarship awaits thorough excavation, by contending that immense research potential sits like ‘gold nuggets’ on the ground.</p>
                        <p>Danny Cassidy was interviewed in his home in San Francisco on July 20, 2008 by Peter Quinn. This oral history was digitally recorded on a Marantz PMD660. It is 148 minutes and 49 seconds long, on three CDs, and has been logged at five minute intervals.</p>

                        <p>Kathleen Walsh D’Arcy (b. 1948), a social worker, writer, and organizer of the St. Pat’s for All Parade in Queens (est. 2005), is the daughter of 1920s immigrants from Co. Offaly and Co. Tipperary. She co-edited two fiction collections by Irish women writers,

                        <p>Some of the themes that D'Arcy focuses on in these interviews include: class divisions in Irish post-war community and how Kathleen related in an up-scale school environment; growing up in an extremely Irish-oriented household; parents were very open and Kathleen thinks that they were unique in that way (track 4); she was in a convent, as a novitiate, for a year; McNiff school of dancing (track 5); and her work in Dublin in the early 1970s.</p>
                        <p>This oral history was digitally recorded on a Marantz PMD660. The interview took place over two sessions: February 12, 2009 and April 22, 2009. The 2/12/09 interview is approximately 2 hours long and on two CDs, and the 4/22/09 interview is approximately 70 minutes long. The interviews both took place in New York, and the interviewer was Myriam Nyhan.</p>

                        <p>Joan Dolan’s first memories come from her time as a child growing up in Ireland. Her mother had moved her there from New York when she was only two and a half years old to live with her grandparents and her uncle. She had grown up on a small farm in Killarue, and she attended National School in Cavan until the age of eleven. Her parents and had come back to Ireland in order to bring her back to the United States. She has thought about her return to America at age eleven after spending nine years in Ireland. Joan only knew life on the small farm on which she lived. She felt that moving to New York was both exciting; however she has second guessed her parents’ decision to bring her back to the United States. She does not have regrets about returned when she did, as affirms that she has a wonderful life here. She does; however, remember that her uncle wished that she could have stayed until she were grown up, as she brought happiness to the lives of two older people and a bachelor. She thinks perhaps she should have left as a seventeen or eighteen year old. Joan admits that is was difficult reunite with her parents since she really did not know them. She began to know her parents only after she was brought back from Ireland when she was eleven years old in April of 1948. She describes her father as a quiet man who was dedicated to his family and his work. Her mother was a talented cook who had received on the job training in her first years as an immigrant in Providence, Rhode Island.</p>
                        <p>Although she is happy with the way events of her life have turned out, Joan wonders what her life would have been like if she had stayed in Ireland. She does feel; however, that she would have had to have left Ireland in order to immigrate to the United States anyway. It just would have been a matter of time as there would have been little room for her on the farm, and there were few jobs to be found in Ireland. Since she did return at a young age; however, she had to adjust to American life. She recalls the drastic change, “From Killarue to Times Square, my goodness.” She attended St. Jean Baptiste High School on the Upper East Side where she admits that it was difficult to fit in at first. The immigrant mentality focused on assimilation. Joan remembers that she did not want to project an image of Irishness in school; rather, she wished to be seen as an American. These feelings changed as she grew past her adolescence, and she wished to explore and promote her Irish culture.</p>
                        <p>When Joan was twelve years old, her parents enrolled her in Irish dancing classes in 1949 under the direction James McKenna. She describes him as a strict, yet effective instructor. She had lost interest in dancing after a year of lessons, and she decided to quit. When she was nineteen, Joan resumed Irish dancing under the direction of Peter and Cyril McNiff. She became one of their ceili dancers, and she danced competitively for four years. She describes her time she spent dancing as one of the greatest parts of her life—she danced because she enjoyed dancing, and so she could be around the friends she made in her ceili, including Andy McCann, Eva McManus, Peter McNiff, Cyril McNiff, Hannah O’Leary, Larry Reddigan, Peter Smith, Gerry Wallace, Lori Walsh, Mike Bergin Peggy Bergin, Edmund Brown, Joan Cass, Eugene Clancy, Pat Clancy, and Jimmy Erwin. She described the ceili uniforms of her team as being quite simple—green skirts, white stockings, white shirt, and a black dance jacket. She compares those more traditional outfits to many of the new styles used in Irish dancing today. She very much approves of popular productions such as Riverdance because have brought Irish dancing into the mainstream; however, the outfits—wigs, outrageous colors, and fancy embroidery—really do not embody the spirit of the dance; rather they commercialize the Irish dancing.</p>
                        <p>After Joan married Felix Dolan, she lived in the Woodlawn and Highbridge sections of the Bronx. Both areas were decidedly Irish; however once she had kids, the Dolan family moved to Golden’s Bridge in Westchester County, NY. She believes that she has gravitated towards people with common interests. Even though this section of Westchester was ethnically diverse, Joan managed to find many Irish friends, including her best friend Ann McEnearny.</p>
                        <p>Joan sincerely believes that it is important that her Irish culture lives on through the generations. Joan gave her children traditional Irish names, and she afforded all of them Irish dancing lessons. Her children have now named their own children traditional Irish names, and some of them have begun Irish dance lessons. In addition to dance, Joan also believed that attending Irish events as a family promoted the preservation of Irish culture. Joan has practiced what she believes as the Dolan family has marched annually with the Gaelic League in the St. Patrick’s Day Parade. Today Joan continues to attend ceilis as she still retains her passion for dancing.</p>
                        <p>This oral history with Joan Dolan was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR 420. It is 120 minutes long, on 2 CDs. The interview took place on November 16, 2006, and the interviewers were Andrew Ciancimino and Marion R. Casey.</p>

                        <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                        <p>Joan Dolan, a former McNiff dancer and founding member of the Bedford (NY) Ceili group, was born in Manhattan, New York on 24 March 1937. Her parents were both from near Cootehill in Co. Cavan, Ireland. After emigrating circa 1930 to the United States, Thomas Lynch (from Drumnatrade) settled with his aunts in Tenafly, New Jersey while Margaret McCaffrey (from Killarue) worked as a cook for a Miss Robinson in Providence, Rhode Island. They met in 1936 at a County Cavan Society dance in Manhattan and were married shortly thereafter at St. Ignatius Loyola on the Upper East Side. At the time their only child, christened Mary Johanna, was born, Thomas Lynch was working for Jack Frost Sugar in Long Island City.</p>
                        <p>In 1939, Margaret Lynch brought two-and-a-half year old Joan to Ireland to live with her McCaffrey grandparents. Shortly thereafter World War II broke out in Europe and the Lynch family remained separated until Christmas 1947. Joan was educated at the local national school in Killarue until 1948 when she was brought back to New York City by her parents. She attended St. John the Evangelist grammar school on East 55th Street until the family settled in an apartment on Third Avenue in Yorkville, when she enrolled in nearby St. Jean Baptiste High School on East 75th Street.</p>
                        <p>When Joan was twelve she took Irish step dancing lessons for one year from the Co. Kerry-born dancing master James T. McKenna (1885-1977). After graduating high school and going to work as a secretary in the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Joan Lynch started dancing lessons again, this time with Peter and Cyril McNiff who had helped introduce a new “northern” style of Irish step dancing during the 1950s and whose students often appeared on national television, such as on the 
                            <emph render="italic">Ed Sullivan Show</emph>. As one of the McNiff ceili dancers, Joan Lynch performed and competed in the metropolitan area as part of a group rather than individually. During this four year period, she met Felix Dolan (b. 1937), a second-generation Irish traditional musician from the Bronx, who played piano for McNiff dance rehearsals. They married in 1959 and raised four children: Phelin, Siobhán, Brendan and Dierdre. Irish music and dance continued to define their married life, first in the Highbridge and Woodlawn sections of the Bronx, and later in Golden’s Bridge in Westchester County.</p>
                        <p>In 1981 the Dolans relocated to Paris for Felix’s work in information security with for IBM. Irish set dancing – an older group form distinct from both step and ceili dancing – was being revived in Ireland at the time and shortly thereafter generated great interest in the United States. When Joan Dolan returned to New York in 1984, she took up set dancing with a passion and became a founding member of the Bedford Ceili, a monthly Irish music gathering in Westchester that was a critical force in the local Irish set dancing revival. At the time of this interview, Joan Dolan was dancing with the Michael Coleman Music Club in Yonkers and helping to raise her seven young grandchildren.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Dunn discusses a range of topics, beginning with his childhood growing up in Sunnyside, Queens. After failing out of St. Teresa’s Catholic School, Woodside, Queens, in the 7th grade, Dunn went on to finish the year at St. Anthony’s Catholic School in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. At the age of 16 Dunn dropped out of Queens Vocational High School and began a series of part-time jobs that lasted for a year. When he was 17 Dunn enlisted in the Navy. He was stationed in Guantanamo, Cuba for four years, and was discharged at the age of 21.</p>
                        <p>Dunn discusses his time in the Navy where he completed the G.E.D. (General Equivalency Diploma). While in the service, he also prepared for the city civil service test. He took the exam for the fire service. After passing the test and returning to New York, Dunn began his career as a fireman. He quickly climbed up the ranks of the fire service, moving from rookie fireman to deputy chief, lieutenant, and captain. Dunn then returned to school with the help of the G.I. Bill, and applied to Queens College in New York. Eventually, he received his Bachelors and Master’s Degrees. In 1959, at the age of 24, Dunn married his wife Patricia. He tells of the purchase of their first house in Douglaston, New York and the decoration of its backyard with stone faces and gargoyle statues acquired from torn down buildings in Harlem.</p>
                        <p>Dunn retired in 1999 after serving 42 years as a fireman. Two years later the attacks on the World Trade Center occurred. Dunn remarks upon the construction of these buildings and their collapse.

                        <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                        <p>Vincent Dunn was born in 1935 in 48th Street, Sunnyside Queens. His father, Magnus Vincent Dunn, worked for New York City as a clerk in the controller’s office. His mother, Rose Ann, worked various jobs but was a homemaker during his childhood. His great grandfather, James Dunn, was born in Ireland and migrated to the United States in the 1860’s. His grandmother, Catherine, came to America and met Joseph Dunn. They married in Albany and lived in Manhattan. Dunn has one older sister.</p>
                        <p>Dunn began his education at St. Teresa’s Catholic School in Woodside, Queens. After failing out of that school in the 7th grade, Dunn continued his elementary education at St. Anthony’s Catholic School in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. He then attended Queens Vocational High School in Queens until the age of 16 when he dropped out. Soon after, Dunn began a series of part-time jobs in Manhattan, which included working at a butcher’s store on 41st Street and 9th Ave, and working as a shoe stocker at Orbach’s Deptartment Store on 14th Street and 4th Avenue. In 1952, at the age of 17, with the encouragement of his friends, Dunn enlisted in the US Navy. He served his term in Guantanamo, Cuba, working as a seaman on a refrigeration cargo ship, the USS Lioba, where he was also assigned base police duties.</p>
                        <p>Dunn was discharged from the Navy at the age of 21. Later that year, on May 21, 1956, Dunn took the New York City test for the fire service. He was one of the only men in his neighborhood to take the examination. Passing grades and rates of acceptance where low; despite that, Dunn did well on the exam and he began working at a firehouse at 137th Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem. With the exception of a brief period working on Webster Ave in the Bronx, Dunn spent most of his career working in various areas around Manhattan.</p>
                        <p>During his time in the Navy, Dunn completed his G.E.D. With the help of this diploma and the G.I. Bill, Dunn returned to school and took fire safety courses at Queens College. It was there that he received his associate’s degree in Fire Administration in 1962, his bachelor’s degree in Sociology in 1976, and his master’s degree in Urban Studies in 1979.</p>
                        <p>Dunn had a 42 year career in the fire service. During that time he continuously took promotional tests for the department, slowly moving up the ranks. He began his career as a firefighter. In 1963 he was assigned the post of Lieutenant. Ten years later he was named Battalion Commander and was located in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He eventually made it to the position of Division Commander in 1977. With a staff of over 600 Dunn was in charge of fire protection and fire prevention in midtown Manhattan. He served in this position until 1999, when he retired on August 12th.</p>
                        <p>While maintaining his position at the fire department, Dunn also began teaching as an Adjunct Professor at City University of New York, John Jay College, and Manhattan College. He taught many courses, including “Building Construction and Life Safety Systems,” and “Fire Protection Design.” During this time, Dunn also began writing articles for 
                            <emph render="italic">Firehouse Magazine</emph> and WNYF .</p>
                        <p>At the age of 43 Dunn also began authoring textbooks. To date, he has written four, which include: 
                            <emph render="italic">Collapse of Burning Buildings</emph> (PennWell Books, 1988), 
                            <emph render="italic">Safety and Survival on the Fireground</emph> (PennWell Books, 1992), Command and Control of Fires and Emergencies (PennWell Books 2000), and 
                            <emph render="italic">Strategy and Firefighting</emph> (PennWell Books, 2007). These books have become required readings in fire-safety courses around the country.</p>
                        <p>Dunn met his wife, Patricia, who was four years his junior, through a friend in 1956. She was the little sister of a close acquaintance of his, Joseph Rutherford. In 1959 they got married; Dunn was 24. They moved to Elmhurst, Queens, and eventually saved enough money to buy a house in Douglaston, Queens. They have two children. Both kids followed after Patricia’s love of the arts.</p>
                        <p>Dunn, now a retired fireman, continues his work in other aspects of the field. He continues teaching at CUNY John Jay College, and now serves as the contributing editor for both 
                            <emph render="italic">Firehouse Magazine</emph> and 
                            <emph render="italic">WNYF</emph>. Along with this work, Dunn also lectures nationally on fire and firefighter safety. He serves as a management consultant evaluating and planning public fire protection in many areas around the United States, such as Linden, New Jersey, and Larchmont, New York. He is also a safety consultant to the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health-review (NIOSH), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) investigating the World Trade Center emergency response on 9/11.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Fanning discusses his family background, his childhood in 1950s Norwood, Massachusetts, Irish American literature and his own academic and literary pursuits. Fanning begins the interview with background about his family. His father, Charles Fanning Sr., worked in a variety of jobs before settling as a custodian in Norwood public schools. The Fannings roots are in County Monaghan, Ireland. They immigrated during the famine and became farmers in Needham, Massachusetts. Fanning’s mother Frances Patricia Fanning never worked outside the home. Her mother was born in Cork because her parents, who had immigrated to Boston, had returned to Ireland to settle an estate.</p>
                        <p>Fanning describes his childhood in Norwood which he remembers as an ideal time. He explains the separation in Norwood between the Irish, the Yankees and the new immigrants; mainly the groups were divided geographically by ethnic neighborhoods but there was no animosity between the communities. Fanning also talks about his family’s unique attitude towards the Yankees because in previous generations his family included intermarriages between Irish and Yankees.</p>
                        <p>After attending public schools in Norwood, Fanning explains that he then attended Harvard University despite his guidance counselor’s urging to apply to Boston College. At Harvard, Fanning studied literature. When he graduated, he went to the University of California at Berkley where he pursued graduate studies in English. Fanning explains his interest shifted to teaching so he left Berkley to attend Harvard again for its graduate teaching programs. Fanning also admits while reviewing his education choices that fear of being drafted into the Viet Nam War kept him in school. In his final graduate program at the University of Pennsylvania in 1967 , Fanning explains that he discovered his true passion while pursuing American studies and explored the connection between literature and history. Fanning wrote his dissertation on the work of Finley Peter Dunne which examined the Chicago Irish. Fanning also talks about his mentors John Kelleher, professor at Harvard, and Tom Brown at the University of Massachusetts, whose advice directed him toward Dunne.</p>
                        <p>Fanning talks about his teaching career which began at Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts and the competition for teaching posts at the time he was finishing his PhD. He briefly mentions his two year stint teaching at the University of Missouri St. Louis before he went to Southern Illinois University at Carbondale where he founded an Irish studies program. Fanning talks about the reception of the Irish studies program which was positive in Carbondale. He also explains the extensive library of Irish literature at Carbondale which includes letters and manuscripts from Joyce and Yeats. Fanning also discusses Irish American literature at length and the future of Irish American literature.</p>
                        <p>Fanning discusses his work beyond his dissertation, which he later developed into his first book published in 1968. He explains his writing process and his upcoming projects which include a memoir and a novel about Chicago in the 1880s.</p>
                        <p>Charles Fanning was interviewed on 4 November 2009 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Tara Dougherty and Linda Dowling Almeida. The interview is 1 hour, 58 minutes, and 45 seconds long, on 2 CDs.</p>

                        <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                        <p>Charles Fanning was born in Massachusetts in 1942 to Charles Fanning Sr. and Frances Patricia Balduf Fanning. His ancestor Phillip Fanning emigrated from County Monaghan, Ireland, to Boston, via New York, in 1851. Phillip had been a farmer in Monaghan hit by the Famine and became a vegetable farmer in Needham, Massachusetts. Frances’s mother Johanna was born in County Cork, Ireland. Her parents, the McAuliffes, emigrated from Cork to Boston and returned to Ireland to settle an estate when Johanna was born. John Fanning married Sara Rebecca Radcliffe. When Sara died of tuberculosis, John left his young son Charles to be raised by the Radcliffes and disappeared. John’s son Charles married Mary Shed and one of their five children was Charles Fanning, Sr., the interview subject’s father. Charles Sr. and Frances had three children, Charles Jr. in 1942, Jeffery in 1944 and Patricia in 1950. Charles Sr. dropped out of school in the sixth grade and worked as a welder during World War II, but due to health issues, moved to a gas station and then to Norwood public schools as a custodian. Frances never worked outside of the home.</p>
                        <p>Fanning, Jr. grew up in Norwood Massachusetts, a self contained working class community outside of Boston, where he attended the public schools with his siblings. His brother Jeffery began his career as a science teacher and football coach. He eventually became superintendent of schools in Stoneham, MA. Jeffery is now retired and splits his time between Maine and Florida. Fanning’s sister Patricia is chair of sociology at Bridgewater State College and is working on a book about the 1918 influenza epidemic in Norwood. An outstanding high school student, Charles applied and was accepted to Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, much to the surprise of his college guidance counselor. Originally recruited as a physics major, Fanning discovered he was more interested in literature so he switched his major to English. After graduating from Harvard, Fanning pursued his first masters’ degree at the University of California at Berkley and majored in English. He changed direction a few years later and began a teaching program at Harvard. In an effort to keep out of the Viet Nam War, Fanning decided to stay in school. In1967 he entered the University of Pennsylvania’s American Studies program and discovered his passion for the interrelationship of history and literature.</p>
                        <p>Fanning accepted a position at Bridgewater State College in Bridgewater, Massachusetts in the fall of 1970 before completing his PhD program at UPenn, under the guidance of John Kelleher at Harvard and Tom Brown at the University of Massachusetts. Fanning focused his dissertation on the writings of Finley Peter Dunne (1867-1936). He finished the research in 1972 and received his masters degree (1968) and his PhD (1972) in American Studies from UPenn. While at Bridgewater, Fanning taught freshman composition classes and survey courses before developing the first Irish literature course at the college. In 1978, Dunne published his first book 
                            <emph render="italic">Finley Peter Dunne and Mr. Dooley: The Chicago Years</emph> which evolved from his dissertation work at UPenn. In 1979, the book won the Organization of American Historians Frederick Jackson Turner Award. After twenty years at Bridgewater, Fanning explored opportunities at other academic institutions, including the University of Notre Dame and Boston College. Fanning worked at the University of Missouri, St. Louis for two years. In 1982 and 1984, Charles and his wife welcomed sons into the world. In 1993, Fanning began teaching at the Southern Illinois University of Carbondale where he was recruited to start an Irish studies program. With a grant and an extensive resource of Irish literature in the Carbondale library, Fanning constructed the successful program which continues to run today.</p>
                        <p>Throughout his teaching career, Fanning continued publishing. In 1990, he published 
                            <emph render="italic">The Irish Voice in America: Irish-American Fiction from the 1760s to the 1980s</emph>. In 1998, Fanning selected and edited stories by James T. Farrell and published the collection 
                            <emph render="italic">Chicago Stories</emph>. In 2000, Fanning edited 
                            <emph render="italic">New Perspectives on the Irish Diaspora</emph>, a collection of essays.</p>
                        <p>Fanning retired in 2007 and lives in Carbondale, IL. He is working on his memoir and a novel set in Chicago in the 1880s which will feature a fictional depiction of a young Finley Peter Dunne.</p>

                        <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
                        <p>Fr. Grange begins by discussing how his parents met on vacation at Rockaway Beach in Queens, New York. He talks extensively about his relatives and their experiences in New York. His grandparents on his mother’s side were both from Ireland, coming to the United States at an early age. His grandfather eventually became the manager of the Harvard Club of New York City, which along with his investments, allowed him to purchase a brownstone on Alexander Avenue, “the Irish Fifth Avenue,” in the South Bronx. Recalling his father’s side, Fr. Grange reveals that his grandmother had had three husbands prior to his grandfather. His grandfather and all of his uncles were policemen, and his aunt worked for the New York City Parks department. Fr. Grange compares his immigrant family’s entry into civil service positions with the current trend of Mexican immigrants joining the ranks of city employees.</p>
                        <p>Although his mother’s parents did not talk much about Ireland, Fr. Grange explains that he does not think they were involved with the insurrections against the British around the time of the Easter Rising in 1916. Coming to the U.S. at very young ages, Fr. Grange believes they were told to leave home because there was not enough food, and as a result they never went back to Ireland. Instead, his grandfather participated in the Irish American community in New York, joining the annual Feis, an Irish dance and music competition. His father was a very steady man, refusing to drink because his younger brother died from alcoholism.</p>
                        <p>Fr. Grange discusses his mother’s siblings, explaining how his mother’s eldest brother was thrown out of the New York Seminary. His aunt was a nun in the Sisters of Charity order. Another uncle was also temporarily thrown out of the seminary, but eventually organized a missionary group in Harlem in the 1930s, which conducted hundreds of conversions and baptisms a year for the predominantly African-American community that had migrated from the South in the 1920s. Discussing another aunt, Fr. Grange describes the abusive relationship she had with her husband. She is now the last survivor of that generation. The child born after her died early, which strongly affected Fr. Grange’s grandmother. Fr. Grange mentions that later in life, his grandmother had Alzheimer’s, which would cause her to sit in her rocking chair all day, waiting for her husband to return from work.</p>
                        <p>Fr. Grange moves on to talk about his father’s side of the family in Rockaway Beach. He remembers going to their house and being bored because there were not many children to play with, and an episode in which they killed ducks in the backyard. Fr. Grange mostly interacted with his mother’s side of the family. His parents moved around to progressively larger apartments as his family grew, near his grandmother’s home on Alexander Avenue.</p>
                        <p>Fr. Grange describes going to school at St. Jerome’s, where he was taught by the Ursuline nuns for the first six years, and the De La Salle Christian Brothers until secondary school. At that time, St. Jerome’s was a growing parish with many vocations. He remembers that the priests had fancy cars and were very respected in the community. The only priest from Ireland in the parish left to go on a mission to Peru, where he was threatened by the terrorist group, the Shining Path , but survived to afterwards become the Chaplain of Cork University. Fr. Grange discusses another woman he knows who was killed by the Shining Path. Fr. Grange then returns to discussing his schooling, describing the brothers as very strict and penal. After graduating St. Jerome’s, Fr. Grange attended Cathedral Preparatory Seminary in Flushing, Queens, explaining that the students got off on Thursdays instead of Fridays, so that they could not attend dances. Fr. Grange’s twin brother, Joseph, left after the first four years of seminary school, but Fr. Grange stayed on. Before being ordained in 1966, Fr. Grange took a year off to teach English and History at Immaculata High School in Manhattan. After his ordination, Fr. Grange noticed other priests who were learning Spanish and working with the growing communities of Puerto Ricans, which influenced him to go to language school in Puerto Rico.</p>
                        <p>After returning from Puerto Rico, Fr. Grange explains that he was assigned to work at St. Columba School in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. While there, he became more involved with the Puerto Rican community. After six years, Fr. Grange was transferred to Annunciation School in Harlem, which was a primarily Dominican community. When Annunciation was given over to Spanish priests, he took the opportunity to arrange a transfer to St. Jerome’s with the ambition of eventually becoming a pastor. In the 1980s, a large influx of Mexican immigrants started visiting him and attending church at St. Jerome’s. Fr. Grange describes how mass attendance continued to grow over the years despite the difficulties the undocumented Mexican immigrant community faced. Fr. Grange explains that in the late nineties, St. Jerome’s began to physically decay, prompting him to confront Cardinal Egan about funding for the renovation. Cardinal Egan decided to give St. Jerome’s the funding to renovate the Church, but three years later, he awarded the parish to a group of Argentinean priests and transferred Fr. Grange to St. Athanasius in the Bronx. Fr. Grange discusses the tension between the St. Jerome’s parish and their new priests that stems from their cultural and religious differences. Fr. Grange also mentions the problem of illegal immigrants wanting to get married, but not being able to under New York law. Fr. Grange’s new parish, St. Athanasius, is a mostly Puerto Rican community. He expresses concern for the parish, as most of the parishioners are elderly and oftentimes he performs several funerals a week.</p>
                        <p>Fr. Grange explains that part of what has slowed him down recently has been an inflammatory disease called Polymyalgia Rheumatica, which causes severe pain in his back. He goes on to discuss how the changes made during Vatican II have made the Church more compassionate, but that not all religious have embraced the changes. Although there has been an increase in Spanish-speaking priests in the archdiocese, many have not fully invested in the communities they serve. Fr. Grange expresses concern about recently installed Cardinal Timothy Dolan, considering the problematic relationship former Cardinal Egan had with the priests. Fr. Grange goes on to discuss the problematic role of Pope Benedict XVI and the schism in the Church between those who agree with the Vatican II changes and those who do not. He mentions the lack of priests in the South Bronx, and the recent increase in violence.</p>
                        <p>Then Fr. Grange discusses the community’s treatment of priests following the sexual abuse scandals. Fr. Grange comments on the various ways the Church has attempted to improve awareness about sexual abuse. Although there have been some leadership problems and “joy” has left the Church as an institution, Fr. Grange fundamentally believes that God is in the Church.</p>
                        <p>Then Fr. Grange goes on to describe a typical day in his life, which begins with Qigong, Tai-Chi, and meditation. Fr. Grange discusses his love for swimming and how he held the record in his age group for the 100-yard free-style for five consecutive years.</p>
                        <p>Fr. Grange explains that he rarely visits his former parish at St. Jerome’s, except to perform occasional funerals or marriages. Although his family is Irish-American, Fr. Grange does not identify with them, but rather feels a stronger connection with the Mexican community. Then, turning to his former political involvement, Fr. Grange discusses his involvement with the South Bronx Churches, an ecumenical group founded to protect the rights and quality of life for residents of the South Bronx. One of their main causes was to build houses for people in need. Fr. Grange ends by relating a story about the destruction of Church property while he was protesting with South Bronx Churches against poor medical care at Lincoln Hospital, prompting him to write a letter to Cardinal John Joseph O’Connor.</p>
                        <p>Father John Grange was interviewed on 29 October 2009 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Caitlin O’Brien and Linda Dowling Almeida. The interview is 1 hour, 51 minutes long, and 39 seconds long, on 2 CDs. The interview took place on October, 2009.</p>

                        <p>Fr. Sean Grange was born in 1940 along with twin brother, Joseph, to parents Margaret and Joseph. Fr. Grange’s parents both grew up on the West Side of Manhattan, but met on summer vacation in Rockaway Beach, Queens. Fr. Grange’s grandparents on his mother’s side emigrated from Ireland when they were very young. Fr. Grange grew up in the neighborhood of Mott Haven, South Bronx around Alexander Avenue, the “Irish Fifth Avenue.” He went to grammar school at St. Jerome’s, where he would later serve as pastor. Fr. Grange graduated from Cathedral Preparatory Seminary in Flushing, Queens and was ordained in 1966. Fr. Grange served at several different parishes, before returning to St. Jerome’s in 1976. Beginning in the early eighties, a large influx of Mexican immigrants began attending services at St. Jerome’s, bringing new life into the church. When the church was on the verge of being shut down, Fr. Grange persuaded the Archdiocese to secure funding for the renovation of St. Jerome’s, resulting in the creation of the Hand’s Community Center. In 2007, Fr. Grange was transferred to St. Athanasius Parish, where he still works today.</p>

                        <p>Tom Hanley (b. 1939) was born in Jersey City and raised in Hoboken, New Jersey where he attended Catholic schools until the seventh grade. He grew up in poverty and often resorted to shoplifting food and clothes as an adolescent to survive. When he was only 14 years old, he was given a role in the movie 
                            <emph render="italic">On the Waterfront</emph> starring Marlon Brando and directed by Elia Kazan.</p>
                        <p>By the time he was 16 years old, he had dropped out of school and found a job in a book-binding factory to earn money. A year later, he convinced his older brother to help him forge the necessary documents to meet the age requirements for employment as a longshoreman on the waterfront. Hanley was hired by Union Local 881 and worked on the docks for 53 years. He was heavily involved in union politics, often challenging the leadership and getting into situations where he was nearly killed for not cooperating with the officers. However, in 2003 the government took over his local and honest officer elections were finally conducted that allowed the longshoremen the freedom to make their own decisions.</p>
                        <p>Hanley has been retired for one year and currently lives in Bayonne, New Jersey.</p>

His dad's allegiance to De Valera through the 1920s and 1930s cost him and the family dearly. Hartigan Sr.'s political choices led to financial and social reverses for the family and ultimately the migration of Daniel, Jr. and most of his siblings. Life for this IRA family in the west of Ireland during the 20s and through World War II offered few other options.</p>

                        <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                        <p>Patrick Hurley was born in Wellington, New Zealand on July 26, 1962. His parents were Irish immigrants who went to New Zealand in search of new opportunities following the decline of the Irish economy. When he was four years old, Hurley’s family returned to Ireland to live in Skibbereen, County Cork. His parents opened a dry cleaners in Skibbereen and ran it successfully for many years.</p>
                        <p>He attended the University College Cork and graduated in 1986. After graduating college, Hurley faced the predicament of many young, educated Irish of the time. A lack of opportunity and a struggling economy left the young Irish with no option but to emigrate. Like many other young Irish men and women, Hurley was no stranger to immigration. His mother, father, and grandparents had all emigrated before him. With this historic familial attachment and several relatives already residing in the States, Hurley naturally looked towards America for new opportunities.</p>
                        <p>His first job in New York was removing asbestos from city buildings. Despite his education, Hurley’s status as an undocumented immigrant limited the jobs he could take. Many other young Irish immigrants faced the same problem. Hurley found work in the building trades, eventually earning him a union card, which allowed him to receive slightly better pay.</p>
                        <p>During this time, Hurley frequently socialized with other Irish immigrants in the typically Irish American neighborhoods of New York City. He became increasingly aware of the problem facing his fellow countrymen in America. Many entered the country on tourist visas, overstayed their visits and then fell into a dangerous limbo where, without proper documentation, health care was not available, deportation was a potential danger, and employers were able to exploit them.</p>
                        <p>These concerns and their own experiences as immigrants led Hurley and others to found the Irish Immigration Reform Movement (IIRM) in May of 1987. The IIRM was a grassroots organization that hoped to change the status of undocumented Irish immigrants through legislative reform. By rallying well-known Irish Americans in the media and politics, the grassroots effort captured national attention. The IIRM grew to include branches in Boston, Chicago and San Francisco. Some former members of the organization have called Hurley “the face of the IIRM”. For nearly four years, Hurley and other members of the IIRM worked tirelessly for legislative reform until the passage of the Family Unity and Employment Opportunity Immigration Act of 1990 (HR 4300).</p>
                        <p>However, Hurley’s path to adjusted status was rockier than most. In 1986, Congressman Brian J. Donnelly (D-MA) attached an amendment to the Immigration Reform and Control Act that allowed for 40,000 non-preference visas to be allotted for residents of 36 countries identified as disadvantaged by the 1965 Immigration Act, including Ireland. An organized application effort by the Irish resulted in 16,000 Irish receiving visas. Ironically, Hurley was not able to obtain a visa because he had been born in New Zealand. The United States State Department identifies immigration status by the country of birth. At a chance meeting with Donnelly at a bar in Washington, D.C, while advocating for reform, Hurley explained his story. The next year HR 4300 was passed. It granted 50,000 out of 120,000 available visas to the Irish over a period of three years. An amendment was attached at the last moment for Hurley’s sake that made him eligible for a visa. After nearly four years of hard work, the IIRM, and Hurley, finally saw results for all its efforts.</p>
                        <p>Hurley received his visa in 1991 and officially became a United States citizen in 1997. He remains politically involved and lives in Woodside, Queens with his wife Mary and their two sons.</p>

                        <p>Sister Theresa begins the discussion with a description of her parents lives in Ballinlough, County Roscommon, Ireland. She includes information such as what life was like there in general, as well as the work involved with owning a family farm. She recalls that her parents lived on the same street but came over to America separately and for different reasons in the early 1920s.</p>
                        <p>Sister Theresa talks about her parents’ occupations after arriving in America. Her mother worked as a housekeeper and was later promoted to cook. Her father’s occupation as a police officer in combination with her mother’s strong money management enabled the couple to buy their own home. This was the house that Sister grew up in the Brooklyn, New York neighborhood of Bushwick with her two older siblings, James and Mary Anne. When Sister was five, her older brother left to attend the seminary, St. Joseph’s College in Princeton, New Jersey, eventually fulfilling his passion and becoming ordained as a Vincentian priest. Sister explains the differences between Vincentian and diocesan priests, and goes on to describe a typical day for a priest and his duties in general.</p>
                        <p>Sister Theresa attended the single-sex Catholic educational institution St. John the Baptist grammar school. She went on to attend Bishop McDonnell Memorial High School in Brookyln, also a single-sex Catholic school. Sister Theresa mentions that being around religious figures her whole life played a part in motivating her to become a nun. However, after graduating in 1952, she was not yet sure of what she wanted to do, and went on to work in the accounting department at Pfizer Incorporated. After five years, in 1957, Sister Theresa chose to join the Brooklyn Sisters of Mercy. She talks about her various assignments at different schools, ranging from her first teaching assignment in Sunnyside, Queens, to a librarian at St. Patrick’s on Kent Avenue in Brooklyn, as well as her work as principal at Our Lady of Refuge in East Flatbush, Brooklyn.</p>
                        <p>It was during her assignment at St. Patrick’s on Kent Avenue that Vatican II occurred. Sister Theresa describes the changes she saw in the Church, the effects the movement had on Catholic educations and the habit, as well as on the convent itself and the women within it. Sister’s opinion of the reforms were mostly negative. She believes that before Vatican II the women in the convent had a strict schedule that was followed, and without that kind of structure the women felt lost; she points to this as one of the changes that provoked many women to leave. She also disliked the changes in the habit. She discusses in detail the full habit nuns used to wear before Vatican II, as well as why she enjoyed wearing it and why she still wears the modified habit today, even though it is not a requirement. However, she does mention that she enjoyed the new freedom nuns had to vacation and visit family whenever they chose, as compared to before when time away from the convent was limited. She describes her family’s home in Breezy Point, Queens, and the joy it brought her to be able to go back there for vacations. Sister also discusses the effects Vatican II had on the convent, the Church and religion in general, as well as its impact on Catholic educations.</p>
                        <p>Sister Theresa also discusses her Irish identity throughout the interview. She remembers listening to the Irish radio stations with her mother, and mentions that her sister took Irish dancing classes. She describes her Irishness as being inherent, and something that has always simply been a part of her. When asked about her Irish-American identity she explains that although she does not necessarily think about it, she knows she is Irish, and describes herself as more Irish than American, but that the greatness of America is also simply a part of who she is.</p>
                        <p>Sister Theresa ends with a discussion about her current position at Our Lady of Mercy Academy in Syosset, New York, as event coordinator, where she organizes school events and fundraisers. She mentions the various events she handles yearly and the amount of money raised at some of them.</p>
                        <p>This oral history with Sister Theresa Kelly was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 2 hours, 28 minutes long, on 3 CDs, and has been logged at ten minute intervals. Sister Theresa Kelly was interviewed on November 8, 2007, at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Kristina Galati, Linda Dowling Almeida, and Joseph Ready.</p>

                        <p>Theresa Kelly, (b. Brooklyn, NY, 28 October 1934), a Sister of Mercy, is the youngest child of Michael Kelly (1889-1946) , a New York City police officer and his wife, Mary (1897-1991), both immigrants from Ballinlough, Castlerea, Co. Roscommon, Ireland. She was raised in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, where she attended St. John the Baptist grammar school on Lewis Avenue. After graduating from Bishop McDonnell Memorial High School in 1952 she started working for the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, in the accounting department.</p>
                        <p>Daily contact with nuns of various orders and other religious figures in her childhood neighborhood and parish — as well as her brother James’ decision to become a priest — played a part in Theresa Kelly’s developing vocation. After five years with Pfizer, she joined the Sisters of Mercy in 1957. Founded in Dublin in 1831 by Mother Catherine McAuley, the first Sisters of Mercy came from Ireland and arrived in New York in 1843 to work with the sick, poor, and uneducated who, at that time, were predominantly Irish immigrants.</p>
                        <p>Sr. Theresa Kelly’s first assignment in April 1960 was to Queen of Angels parish school in Sunnyside, Queens. There she taught co-ed classes, including first grade in the morning session and art in the afternoon to sixth, seventh, and eighth graders.

                        <p>Tom Kelly was born in 1961 and grew up in the blue-collar neighborhoods of Inwood, Upper Manhattan, and New Milford, New Jersey. His father worked on the freight yards of the Bronx, and his mother worked as a secretary. Tom Kelly first gravitated towards construction work at the age of fifteen and continued in the field until he was twenty-five. He attended Fordham University, New York City’s Jesuit school, where he studied political economy, and received a master’s degree from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government in 1988. Kelly worked his way through Fordham as a sandhog, helping to build Water Tunnel Three. He also worked in other construction jobs around the city such as roadwork, excavation, demolition, and pouring concrete on high-rises. This gave Kelly an inside look at the construction industry and its corruption. Kelly’s experience contributed to the research for his novels 
                            <emph render="italic">Payback</emph> and 
                            <emph render="italic">The Rackets</emph>. Through the unions, Kelly got involved in politics. He worked as the director of advance for David Dinkins' re-election campaign in 1993. Dinkins, a democrat, was the first African-American mayor in New York City history. He was defeated in 1993 by Rudolph Guiliani. Kelly worked for the Teamsters as a political operative and ran a non-profit organization that provided services for laid-off workers (union and non-union) during the federal takeover of the Teamsters. Tom Kelly has received critical acclaim for all three of his novels:

                        <p>Thomas Lynch (b. 1948) was born in Michigan and was raised in the suburb of Birmingham. Lynch was raised in an Irish-Catholic community and attended traditional Catholic schools. He graduated from Brother Rice High School in 1966 and went on to attend Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, before deciding to leave school and visit Ireland in 1970. After being introduced to famous poets such as W.B. Yeats and James Joyce at university by Professor Michael Heffernan, Lynch made his first attempts at writing poetry while staying in Ireland with his cousins Tommy and Nora Lynch. Lynch stayed in Ireland for four months before returning to Michigan where in 1971, he entered mortuary school and graduated from Wayne State University Department of Mortuary Science in 1973. Lynch began running the funeral home in Milford in 1974, which he still runs today. Lynch's writing slowed for a short while before he received a copy of Michael Heffernan's first published work in 1978, which inspired him to begin writing again. Lynch published his first collection of poems in 1987 and his first non-fiction work in 1994, which won multiple awards and was a finalist for the National Book Award. Lynch has now published four collections of poems, three works of non-fiction, and one work of fiction. Lynch's work has been featured in many publications such as 
                            <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph> and 
                            <emph render="italic">Times of London</emph>,

                            <emph render="italic">Poetry</emph>. He has also been the subject of two documentaries, one produced by PBS' 
                            <emph render="italic">Frontline</emph>, and the other directed by Cathal Black. Two of Lynch's sons work with him in the funeral business, while his other son is a fly-fishing guide and his daughter is a social worker.</p>

                        <p>Pat Mahon discusses a range of topics from his Irish Catholic childhood in the Bronx to international Irish traditional music competitions and performance to life on Wall Street as an Irish Catholic New Yorker.</p>
                        <p>He begins the interview discussing his family life and youth in the changing and diverse neighborhoods of the Bronx in the 1960s. As the oldest son of Irish immigrants, he and his three siblings were educated in Catholic grammar schools and he and his sister both tested into prestigious public high schools. He reflects on the importance of Irish identity for his parents and how they encouraged their children to build their own ethnic identity through music. Pat learned the button accordion and trained and competed with some well-known figures in the field of traditional music including Joannie Madden, Eileen Ivers, and Brian Conway. He describes his experience as the first American to win the All-Ireland championship in 1973 at the Fleadh in Listowel, Co. Kerry.</p>
                        <p>It is clear from his discussion that music fills a central place in his life. He reflects on his short stint as a professional musician that interrupted his undergraduate education at Fordham University and how the reality of making a living sent him back to City University of New York-Lehman College for a degree in accounting. Despite a 20+ year career on Wall Street he has never abandoned his music and Mahon recalls how he pursued his passion for traditional music while stationed around the world for work, including years in Japan and England. His discussion of the traditional music world and its active participants is among the most fascinating highlights of the interview, in particular, his memories of performing with Eileen Ivers in Japan are wonderful.</p>
                        <p>Mahon also discusses the various career paths of his siblings, particularly his two brothers, who pursued seemingly “typical” Irish vocations in law enforcement. He observes that the attacks on the World Trade Center altered the parameters of their work and made their occupations anything but typical. He speaks candidly about life on Wall Street and the ethnic culture of certain corporations and jobs in the financial services sector, but admitted that he did not suffer one way or the other by being Irish. As an ex-pat for most of his adult life and career, his identity as a “Yank” created more of an identity issue for him.</p>
                        <p>He and his wife have three children who are themselves musicians but who identify themselves as European rather than Irish, American or Irish American. He reflects on how he and his wife met and the Irish background of his wife and her experience as an Irish dancer. He muses on the Riverdance craze and the boost it gave the Irish dance industry around the world, including the dance studio that his sister-in-law operates in Florida. In one anecdote he recalls how out of context it was to see young Japanese girls in “Sheila” wigs at competitions in Japan.</p>

                        <p>Pat Mahon (b. Bronx, NY, February 16, 1958), an executive with Bear Stearns and Co., is the son of immigrants from Ballycastle, County Mayo, Ireland. Martin Joseph Mahon, a New York City bus driver, and Kathleen Teresa Burke, a telephone operator, raised four children in the Crotona Park section of the Bronx where they all learned to play Irish traditional music. In 1973, when he was fifteen and studying with Martin Mulvihill, Mahon became the first American to win the All-Ireland Championship on the button accordion.</p>
                        <p>After attending St. Anthony’s School, the Bronx High School of Science, and a brief time at Fordham University, Mahon tried a career in music. He played in several bands, performing Top 40 hits as well as Irish traditional music in pubs, for weddings and dances, as well as on several cruise ships. He returned to college after a year and a half, earning a B.A. in accounting from Lehman College, City University of New York. Mahon began working as a Certified Public Accountant for Arthur Young and Co. Two years later he moved to Bear Stearns and at the time of this interview, Pat Mahon was their regional manager for middle office operations in Europe. Mahon moved to Tokyo in the early 1990s to expand Bear Stearns’ operations. While in there, he found a diverse group of musicians to play with, and they appeared at events ranging from department store openings to concerts for the Irish Ambassador. He performed with the Chieftains and recorded with Eileen Ivers. After two and a half years, Bear Stearns relocated Mahon to England where he and his wife Mary Jean raised three children, all of whom play Irish music too.</p>
                        <p>Despite having lived abroad for many years, Pat Mahon views himself as strongly Irish and American.</p>

                        <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                        <p>Brian A. McAllister was born in 1932 in Brooklyn, New York, the eighth child of Anthony J. (1899-1984) and Marjorie McAllister. He is the great-grandson of James P. McAllister who emigrated from Cushendall, Co. Antrim and in 1864 founded a lighterage company in New York harbor. This family-owned business, now called McAllister Towing Incorporated, is one of the last surviving tugboat operations in New York City waters today. It has seventy tugboats at nine ports on the east coast, as well as twelve barges; in addition, it owns and operates three ferry vessels running from Port Jefferson, New York to Bridgeport, Connecticut.</p>
                        <p>Raised in his grandfather’s house at 1510 Albemarle Road in the Prospect Park South section of Brooklyn, Brian McAllister was educated at Holy Innocents grammar school and Brooklyn Preparatory High School. In 1956 he graduated with a B.Sc. from the State University of New York Maritime College at Fort Schuyler in the Throg’s Neck section of the Bronx, with several licenses including Third Assistant Engineer. After two years with the United States Navy and several on merchant marine vessels, McAllister traded his below-deck engineering experiences to captain McAllister tugboats, lighters, and ferries for his father. In the early 1970s he moved into office operations in the company headquarters at 17 Battery Place and in 1974 succeeded his father as president of McAllister Towing.</p>
                        <p>Towing in New York City’s harbor declined steadily during the twentieth century--from a high of eight hundred tugboats in 1929--as changes in railroad transport, trucking and containerization affected the number of ships entering and leaving the port. Tugboats “tug” much larger and heavier vessels for a variety of reasons, by attaching one or more towlines, depending on the latest technology. The Depression hit the industry very hard and many towing companies were put out of business during the 1930s. Oil barges became a lifeline until the prices of oil skyrocketed in the 1970s and 1980s, forcing McAllister Towing to diversify and to expand operations to other east coast ports and even Saudi Arabia in order to survive. McAllister Towing and its nearest competitor, Moran Towing Corporation, are the two principal companies remaining in the industry; they have reached a give-and-take balance that benefits both and enables them to continue to make New York harbor their base of operations.</p>
                        <p>Being Catholic rather than being Irish was more central to the identity of the family when Brian McAllister was growing up in Brooklyn. Nevertheless, McAllister’s grandfather, James P. McAllister (1869-1935, known as “Captain Jim” and “Dean of the Harbor”) appears to have been connected to important Irish nationalists in New York City. In June 1919 he sent his son, Anthony, to the Hoboken, New Jersey, piers to bring Eamon de Valera into New York City on a McAllister tugboat. De Valera, President of the nascent Irish Republic, had just escaped from Lincoln prison in England and traveled aboard a German ocean liner to the United States, where he would spend the next eighteen months fundraising for an independent Ireland.</p>
                        <p>In January 1967 Brian McAllister married Rosemary Owens, who taught mathematics at the United Nations International School in New York. At the time of this interview, their sons, Brian Buckley McAllister and Eric Michael McAllister (General Counsel and Treasurer respectively), were Vice Presidents for McAllister Towing.</p>

                        <p>Sean Minihane (b. Co. Cork, Ireland), is an Irish-born member of the New Irish generation of the 1980s and one of the founders of the Irish Immigration Reform Movement (IIRM). Immigrating to New York in 1986, he quickly recognized the plight of his undocumented peers and helped lead the IIRM to lobby for and achieve legislative reform with the passage of the Immigration Act of 1990 HR-4300. The law granted thousands of non-preference visas to immigrants considered disadvantaged by previous legislation, many of whom were Irish.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Murphy discusses a range of topics, beginning with his parents’ background and his childhood in the 1960s and 1970s in Queens, New York. Murphy briefly describes his experience as a student at Our Lady of Lourdes, a Catholic grammar school in Queens. He discusses his education at Regis High School, a full scholarship Jesuit institution in Manhattan. During high school, he began an internship at WPIX (now the CW11), where he learned to write and produce news segments under such figures as Dan Doherty. Murphy explains that after high school graduation, he attended classes at Queens College, but he dropped out at the age of 19 to continue working full-time at the station.</p>
                        <p>In 1981, Murphy moved to WABC where he became the producer of the Six O'Clock Eyewitness News with news anchor Roger Grimsby, who became one of Murphy’s close friends. He also met Adrienne Barr at WABC, whom he would marry in 1986. Murphy relates that after he left WABC, he moved to WCBS, Channel 2, where he worked alongside his sister Mary, a street crime reporter at the time. Murphy then discusses his move to the syndicated film criticism program 
                            <emph render="italic">Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies</emph>.

                        <p>Murphy discusses some of his experiences while working at CBS. He talks about the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and his experience working as executive producer for the Evening News in the days following the attack. He also discusses his involvement in the first network news broadcasts from Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. Murphy also explains how he helped CBS secure an important interview with former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, during which Sharon announced a drastic policy change to break relations with former Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. Finally, Murphy highlights some of the bigger moments of his career, including the day he and Rather interviewed Saddam Hussein just weeks before the outbreak of the Iraq War in 2003. He describes the surreal circumstances when he met Saddam Hussein. Murphy also shares his conversation with Rather and Hussein following the interview, in which Hussein expressed his amazement with American political and media strategies. Finally, Murphy talks about returning to Iraq after the Americans began their occupation, and he describes the changing landscape of Iraq.</p>
                        <p>Murphy then explains that he left CBS in 2005, following Dan Rather’s departure. He talks about taking a job at ABC’s 
                            <emph render="italic">Good Morning America</emph> in 2006, where he currently serves as the senior executive producer, working with anchorwoman Diane Sawyer. Murphy describes the personalities and professional capabilities of anchors such as Rather and Sawyer.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the interview, Murphy elaborates on his personal life, discussing his Irish identity, his departure from the Church, and his family history, touching upon his father’s isolated and abusive personality. He talks about visiting Ireland in the 1960s, the 1970s, and in more recent years. Murphy discusses how the economy in Ireland has transformed the country in the past few decades, and how the Celtic Tiger has affected his own family in Ireland. He reflects on the importance of his Irish identity but also on his tendency not to join Irish fraternal organizations.</p>
                        <p>The small remainder of the interview focuses on his current job at 
                            <emph render="italic">Good Morning America</emph>. Murphy discusses the nature of morning news and his program’s fierce competition with the

                        <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                        <p>Jim Murphy was born on 26 July 1960, at Boulevard Hospital in Astoria, Queens. His father, James T. Murphy, emigrated from County Mayo, Ireland, to New York in 1948. He worked in construction before securing a job with New York City Transit Authority, working as a bus driver in the Bronx. Murphy’s mother, Mary C. Murphy, emigrated from County Galway, Ireland, in the mid-1950s, working as a waitress at Schrafts Restaurant in Times Square when she first arrived. Murphy’s parents met at an Irish dance in the Rockaways and were married in the 1950s.</p>
                        <p>Murphy grew up in Queens, New York, with one older sister, Mary, and two younger sisters, Nora and Celia. He spent the first few years of his life in Woodside, Queens, before his family moved to Queens Village in 1964, where Murphy and his family belonged to Our Lady of Lourdes, a Catholic parish. The following year, the family moved to Floral Park, just three or four miles east of Queens Village. After finishing grammar school at Our Lady of Lourdes, Murphy tested into the rigorous all boys Jesuit institution, Regis High School, in Manhattan, where all students attend the school tuition free. Murphy became increasingly interested in current events during high school, often reading the 
                            <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> and listening to news radio at home alongside his father.</p>
                        <p>During his senior year, Murphy applied for internships in order to escape the Regis classroom and work during his final trimester of school. After applying to a few internships, he began to intern at WPIX-TV New York (now the CW11). Soon Murphy began to realize his love for the newsroom, and upon high school graduation, he became a full-time employee at WPIX. Murphy chose to stay in New York and attend Queens College, where his sister Mary also went to school. Since Murphy worked full-time, it became increasingly difficult for him to manage classes and his job. At first, he lived at home with his family near Queens College and commuted to class. But after a few years, Murphy eventually dropped out of college at age 19 and moved out of his house and into his own apartment in Manhattan. Working under figures such as Dan Doherty at WPIX, Murphy learned how to write stories and produce news shows at an early age.</p>
                        <p>In 1981, Murphy moved to WABC-TV, the ABC owned station, where he spent close to five years. By the age of 21, he became the producer of the flagship 
                            <emph render="italic">Six O'Clock Eyewitness News</emph> with anchor Roger Grimsby. During this time, he met Adrienne Barr, also a producer at the station, and the two married in 1986. Just after his marriage, Murphy left to work at WCBS (Channel 2) in New York, where he worked alongside his sister, Mary, a street crime reporter, until 1988. Itching to get out of the newsroom, Murphy asked the network for more field experience. While on assignment to report on a Chicago Bears and New York Giants football game, he met Gene Siskel on the plane to Chicago. When their flight was delayed, Murphy, Siskel, and his wife, who had also worked at Channel 2, spent hours talking. Soon after, Siskel offered Murphy the position of supervising producer and director of his nationally syndicated film criticism program, 
                            <emph render="italic">Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies</emph>. Murphy took the job in Chicago.</p>
                        <p>While working in Chicago for the next four and a half years, Murphy also helped to write and produce documentaries with Siskel and Ebert. He and his wife, Barr, attempted a “commuter marriage” for the first six to eight months of his new job, but soon Barr left New York City to join Murphy in Chicago. After missing the newsroom and New York City, Murphy decided to move back east with his wife. In 1993, on his last day of work in Chicago, Murphy learned that his wife was pregnant with their first child, Liam, even after doctors had told the couple they would never have children.</p>
                        <p>Back in New York, Murphy returned to broadcast news to work at CBS’s morning news program, 
                            <emph render="italic">This Morning</emph>. He first served as a segment producer of the broadcast. Within months he became the senior broadcast producer of 
                            <emph render="italic">This Morning</emph>, and then finally the executive producer. After two years, Murphy moved to the CBS program 
                            <emph render="italic">48 Hours</emph>, working as deputy producer under the executive producer Susan Zarinsky. Two years later in 1999, he joined the CBS Evening News team, after Dan Rather asked Murphy to work for his program. By 2000, Murphy became the executive producer of the Evening News, the same year his daughter Tea was born.</p>
                        <p>Under Murphy’s leadership, the CBS Evening News won several awards, including six Emmy Awards. Murphy, among other members of his team, was recognized with the Alfred I. DuPont Award in 2002 and 2003, as well as the RTDNA Edward R. Murrow Award for “Overall Excellence” in 2003. While working at CBS, Murphy experienced some of his most important career moments. His program reported on the September 11th World Trade Center attacks while Murphy served as executive producer. CBS also produced the first network news broadcasts from Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. Murphy even helped to secure an important interview with former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, in which Sharon made an important policy change to break relations with former Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. Finally, Murphy and Rather interviewed Saddam Hussein just weeks before the outbreak of the Iraq war in 2003.</p>
                        <p>After six years at CBS News, Murphy departed in November 2005, after Dan Rather resigned. In the summer of 2006, Murphy joined ABC’s 
                            <emph render="italic">Good Morning America</emph> team as the senior executive producer of this network morning show, working with executive producer Tom Cibrowski, and co-anchor Diane Sawyer. After choosing new team members for 
                            <emph render="italic">Good Morning America</emph> in 2006, Murphy continues to compete for morning news ratings, vying with NBC’s 
                            <emph render="italic">Today Show</emph> to gain the top spot.</p>
                        <p>Murphy currently lives in New York City with his wife and two children, Liam, 14, and Tea, 7. While his father passed away in October 2007, his mother still lives on West End Avenue. Murphy’s sister Mary continues to work as an on-air reporter and lives in Queens. His sister Nora works on Wall Street, while his other sister, Celia, who worked in banking, now lives in Connecticut with her family.</p>

                        <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
                        <p>Sister Regina Murphy discusses many aspects of her life, beginning with her parents’ immigration to America and her childhood in Riverdale, New York. She details the occupations her parents held as new arrivals in America – her mother a live-in maid and her father a clerk in a grocery store. When her parents wed her father quickly bought out a grocery store, and her mother stopped domestic work and assisted in the store.</p>
                        <p>Sister Regina Murphy reviews her childhood – she received religious education throughout her life, attending St. Margaret’s School in Riverdale for primary education, New York, Sacred Heart of Mary High School, and two years at Marymount College in Tarrytown before she entered the convent. She stresses that her religious education during those formative years greatly influence her decision to enter the convent.</p>
                        <p>Sister Regina Murphy discusses her decision to enter the convent, against the wishes of her parents. Four years earlier, her older brother Tommy joined the brothers. He would leave before taking final vows, but at the time she entered the convent in 1959, he was still with the brothers. She declares that the only time she remembers her father using profanity was when she told him she wanted to enter the convent. In a similarly vehement reaction, her mother tore up her acceptance letter to the Sisters of Charity, and it was only upon further inquiry with the order that Sister Regina Murphy learned she had been accepted. Although her parents did not initially accept her vocation, Sister Regina Murphy says she felt truly called to enter the convent. She recalls that she was especially stirred at the prospect of doing missionary work.</p>
                        <p>Sr. Murphy describes her first foreign mission was to the Bahamas. She worked in education, but during her tenure, she noticed the stark difference between the lives of the native poor and the tourists who visited the Bahamas. This started her personal quest for a better understanding of social justice principles. She talks about her appointment as Mission Coordinator for the order, and how she was able to visit missions in Guatemala. She recalls meeting with a fellow sister named Barbara Ann Ford, who was influential in creating water projects in the poor villages and who participated in The Recovery of Historical Memory project organized by Bishop Juan Geraldi to collect the stories of the survivors and victims of the civil war in Guatemala. Part of the project included providing mental health service for those who were affected by the rampant violence and crime that accompanied the war. Sr. Barbara was shot and killed in 2001 under suspicious circumstance, however her work in Guatemala helped many and also influenced Sister Regina Murphy.</p>
                        <p>She describes how her experiences in the Bahamas and Guatemala along with the coming of Vatican II sparked an awakening in her. She saw the changes enacted as part of Vatican II as an energizing and necessary force in the Church. It seemed to her that religious work evolved from seeking to help individuals on a day to day basis to fixing the societal infrastructure responsible for basic injustices. These realizations propelled Sister Regina Murphy to become involved in justice, peace, and corporate responsibility projects.</p>
                        <p>When advocating for corporate responsibility, Sister Regina Murphy describes her integral role in the implementation of the McBride Principles and the enactment of the Fair Employment Act in Northern Ireland in 1988. As part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, she traveled to Northern Ireland in the hopes of getting factories to sign onto the McBride Principles. She recalls that the ICCR was successful in obtaining the signatures of fifty companies. While Sister Regina Murphy was in one General Motors Factory in Northern Ireland, she talks about how her presence caused a temporary strike and shutdown of the factory. Although she was not dressed in a traditional habit, workers guessed that she was a Catholic nun. Seeing her discuss workplace issues with managers in the factory upset the predominately Protestant workers, inciting them to walk off the job. Despite this fervor against the McBride Principles, it was her support, along with that of the ICCR, that she says helped to pass the Fair Employment Act.</p>
                        <p>Sister Murphy talks about the current state of vocations in the Church and what she sees for the future of the convent. She describes her life today as a religious woman – what it means to her and what her Irish identity means. She ends the interview talking about her job as property manager for the order, acting as general contractor on major construction projects for the order</p>
                        <p>This oral history with Sister Regina Murphy was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview took place on 9 November 2007 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Julia Ryan and Linda Dowling Almeida. The interview is 2 hours, 47 minutes long, on 2 CDs and had been logged at ten minute intervals.</p>

                        <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                        <p>Regina Murphy (b. Bronx, NY, 2 November 1939), a Sister of Charity, is the daughter of Thomas Paul Murphy, an immigrant from Co. Mayo, Ireland, and Katherine Carey Murphy, from Co. Galway. Her father began working in New York City in James Butler’s groceries until eventually owning and operating a store himself.</p>
                        <p>Educated at St. Margaret of Cortone school in Riverdale and Sacred Heart of Mary High School, Regina Murphy went to Marymount College in Tarrytown, NY, for two years before deciding to enter the Sisters of Charity in 1959. She finished her education at the College of Mount St. Vincent, then obtained graduate degrees from St. Louis University and Fordham University.</p>
                        <p>Sr. Regina started missionary work in the Bahamas in 1969, the same year she took her final vows. Her work there was in education but, witnessing the stark contrast in living standards between the island natives and visiting tourists, she was driven toward peace and justice work, eventually becoming the Mission Coordinator for the Sisters of Charity. In this position Sr. Regina was able to visit other Sisters of Charity working in Guatemala — where forty years of civil war had disrupted lives — to create water projects and set up social service networks. For Sr. Regina, Vatican II was the beginning of a change in the way the Catholic Church perceived social problems and injustice. Rather than simply taking care of day-to-day needs, greater emphasis was placed on the social infrastructure, questioning what needed to be changed to achieve a better quality of life for all members of society. Thus, her work led to her to activism in the area of corporate responsibility. Sr. Regina worked for the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a local coalition of New York-based religious orders with investments in many companies, and she was integral to the establishment of the McBride Principles. Although inspired by labor discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland, the McBride Principles are written as a universal guide for preventing discrimination of any kind in the work place. In 1988 they were instrumental to the implementation of the Fair Employment Act in Northern Ireland.</p>
                        <p>At the time of this interview, Sr. Regina Murphy was the property manager for the Sisters of Charity, overseeing both the maintenance of buildings and construction projects for the order.</p>

                        <p>Ms. O’Callaghan discusses a variety of topics beginning with her family and childhood in Cork, Ireland and what life was like growing up on a farm. After obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in English, French and Sociology at the University of County Cork, she moved to Dublin to pursue a Higher Diploma in Education at Trinity College. In Dublin she was given the chance to teach inner-city kids, a far cry from the one room school house she attended as a child. She describes returning to Cork to work for Cork Local Radio as a news presenter. Wanderlust led her to answer an ad in the newspaper for a job marketing Irish hand-crafts in San Francisco, California. Ms. O’Callaghan was handed an H-3 Visa to live in what describes as a fantasy life in the United States, an experience that was somewhat different from the lives of the people she helped later in life.</p>
                        <p>She talks about how she turned a temporary stay into a permanent move after she left California for New York to work as a flight attendant for Transamerica Airlines. Reintegrating the Irish back into her life, she became involved with Adrian Flannelly’s Irish radio talk show. She describes how the growing number of undocumented Irish in the mid-1980s led Adrian Flannelly to discuss solutions with the Archdiocese of New York. The talks led to the formation of Project Irish Outreach within the Catholic Charities division of the archdiocese, under the supervision of Monsignor James Murray.</p>
                        <p>Asked to help with the project’s establishment, Ms. O’Callaghan found a real purpose in helping the undocumented. She wrote a small booklet titled 
                            <emph render="italic">Immigrating USA: A Guide for Irish Immigrants</emph> to answer immigrants frequently-asked questions. Project Irish Outreach had a great impact on Ms. O’Callaghan and the Irish community and she discusses at length the work that the project was able to do through community outreach, immigration and social services, and partaking in efforts to inform people of their rights. The program became a social worker network in a number of fields.</p>
                        <p>She recalls the mobilization of the Irish American community along with various other social service and legal organizations during the 1980s, also noting the always positive attitude that Americans, especially New Yorkers, have had towards the Irish.</p>
                        <p>While discussing the way her position and role within Catholic Charities has diversified and evolved, Ms. O’Callaghan explains the transformation of Project Irish Outreach since its establishment in 1987. She expresses the many ways in which immigration and the immigrants themselves have changed over time, including the complexity of the immigration system and the choices available to immigrants and emigrants. She delves into the hurdles that the undocumented and documented have to face and the ways the immigration system and legislation can evolve to fit the needs of the immigrant population.</p>
                        <p>She closes with describing the strength of the Irish community and the people that have affected her life through her work and what her Catholic and Irish identities mean to her.</p>
                        <p>Patricia O’Callaghan was interviewed on 2 November 2007 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Katie Hiebert, Linda Dowling Almeida, and Joe Ready. This oral history was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 1 hour, 41 minutes long, on two CDs and had been logged at ten minute intervals.</p>

                        <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                        <p>Patricia O’Callaghan was born on 17 March 1951 in Cork City, Ireland and grew up on a farm with her three sisters five miles outside the city. Her father, John Vincent O’Callaghan, a farmer and cattle trader, was born and raised in Cork and her mother, Doreen Joebges O'Callaghan, was born in London, England, but raised in Dublin, Ireland. Patricia went to primary school at St. Brigid’s on the Mardyke, an all girl’s Catholic school in Cork and later received a diploma in English, French, and Sociology at University College Cork and a Higher Diploma in Education at Trinity College, Dublin in 1972. She took a job with Cork Local Radio after two years teaching English and French in Dublin.</p>
                        <p>In an effort to broaden her professional and geographic horizons, O’Callaghan took a job assisting with public relations and sales at The Kilkenny Shop in San Francisco, California. Her employers paid for her relocation and ‘handed’ her an H-3 Visa. Two years later she received her U.S. Permanent Residence Card. In an effort to explore the East Coast, she applied to the major airlines and was hired as a flight attendant by Transamerica Airlines in 1979. After flying all around the world, she took a renewed interest in Irish radio, introduced herself to Adrian Flannelly, a New York Irish radio personality and offered to work as a volunteer producer for his radio show. In the mid-1980s unemployment rates in Ireland reached almost 19%, sending some 50,000 young undocumented Irish immigrants into America, many of them landing in New York City. These New Irish, as they called themselves, often bonded together, living in small neighborhood communities only able to find work well below their skill level because of their undocumented status. Many of these undocumented were left in the dark, unaware of the steps they could take and the social services they could access to improve their lives. Living in fear of deportation they lacked the capacity or, rather, the resources or references to find health care, and legal and economic assistance.</p>
                        <p>During this time the Irish community in the US mobilized to respond to the growing plight of the undocumented. Social service and legislative reform groups were organized including the Irish Immigration Reform Movement, established in 1987, and the Emerald Isle Immigration Center (EIIC), launched in 1988. Adrian Flannelly, realizing that something needed to be done, began speaking with the Archdiocese of New York to discuss ways they could help bring aid to the undocumented Irish community. Project Irish Outreach was established in 1987 by Monsignor James J. Murray as a program within the Archdiocese of New York’s Catholic Charities division. Monsignor Murray also worked with the bishops of Ireland to send over three priest chaplains and one nun to minister and work directly with the Irish communities in New York City.</p>
                        <p>Adrian Flannelly introduced Patricia O’Callaghan to Project Irish Outreach in 1987 and she has run the project for 20 years. Though her position within Catholic Charities has changed, she has continued to service the needs of immigrants and in 1987 Ms. O’Callaghan was hired as project coordinator for the Refugee Resettlement division of Catholic Charities. Passionate about the needs of the young Irish, O’Callaghan has volunteered her time herself with the working committee of the New York St. Patrick’s Day Ball as well as the Irish Immigration Working Committee based at the Irish consulate in New York.</p>
                        <p>At the time of this interview, O’Callaghan was working as the Director of the Communications Office of Catholic Charities New York since July of 2006 and residing in Manhattan. She, along with Monsignor Kevin Sullivan, was also involved with SIRIUS Satellite Radio producing the show,

                        <p>In this interview, O'Driscoll provides detailed information on her childhood in Skibbereen, County Cork, Ireland, including living in rural Ireland and the effects World War II had on her family such as power outages and food rationing. She discusses the options available to her after secondary school at the time and her decision to immigrate to the United States in 1958 to further her education.</p>
                        <p>Upon arriving in New York City, O’Driscoll interviewed with the three companies in the city known for hiring large numbers of Irish: the phone company, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and Citibank. Within one month of her arrival, O’Driscoll began working at Citibank, a job she kept until 1964. She discusses in detail the discrimination faced by immigrants at the time, including the perception vocalized by an interviewer that the Irish were uneducated. O’Driscoll continues to speak about her early accounting jobs and her eventual hiring at JP Morgan &amp; Co. in 1974.</p>
                        <p>In 1975, O’Driscoll enrolled at Brooklyn College and received her Bachelor of Science degree in accounting in 1981. She talks about her decision to return to school and the impact it had on her career. She discusses the discrimination she dealt with as a woman working on Wall Street at the time including being passed over for promotions and eventually having to change departments because of the lack of advancement opportunities open to her.</p>
                        <p>Active in the Irish community, O’Driscoll became involved in the Ladies Auxiliary of the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH), the National Association for Irish Justice 1969, the Cork Association and in 1989 its first woman president. O’ Driscoll served an integral part in the formation of the Irish Immigration Reform Movement (IIRM) in 1987. She discusses in detail the grassroots efforts of the organization including interaction with legislators and the campaign to raise awareness locally and nationally on the issue and is frank in her assessment of the great obstacles facing the very small group. The IIRM was successful in their efforts in 1990 with the passing of HR-4300, the Immigration Act of 1990. O’Driscoll also speaks about her continued involvement with the Emerald Isle Immigration Center in Woodside, Queens.</p>
                        <p>O’Driscoll currently resides in Brooklyn, New York and is still a member of the Cork Association and a trustee and secretary of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center Executive Committee.</p>
                        <p>Mae O’Driscoll was interviewed at New York University’s Glucksman Ireland House on 18 November 2005 by Bethany Hartzell and Linda Dowling Almeida.

                    <bioghist audience="internal" id="ref486">
                        <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                        <p>Mae O’Driscoll was born in Skibbereen, County Cork, Ireland, in 1939. O’Driscoll was raised on a family dairy farm along with her five brothers and one sister. She attended Nachin National School and the all girls’ school, Convent of Mercy, receiving a leaving certificate. Faced with few educational and career opportunities for women at the time in Ireland and with the intention of only staying two years to attend school, O’Driscoll immigrated to the United States on March 1, 1958, at the age of eighteen. She was met in New York by her brothers who had immigrated earlier. After staying with her brother and his family in the city for three months, O’Driscoll moved with her other three brothers into an apartment in the predominantly Irish neighborhood of Flatbush in Brooklyn, referred to by the Irish community as the Holy Cross Parish, because of the church which anchored the neighborhood.</p>
                        <p>With her brother’s assistance, O’Driscoll interviewed and received a clerical position at Citibank in April 1958. O’Driscoll worked at Citibank until 1964. Returning to New York after a three month trip to Ireland to assist her brother’s family, O’Driscoll worked at various accounting jobs until joining JP Morgan &amp; Co. in 1974. At the same time, O’Driscoll began attending Brooklyn College and graduated in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting.</p>
                        <p>O'Driscoll moved into the facilities management department at JP Morgan in 1979. On Wall Street, O'Driscoll experienced discrimination as a woman and as an immigrant which she believes slowed her elevation up the corporate ladder. Eventually she was promoted to assistant vice president of her department, a position she maintained until 2002, when she retired following the merger of JP Morgan with Chase Manhattan Corporation in 2000.</p>
                        <p>O'Driscoll became involved in the New York Irish community quickly after her arrival. With her brother, she began raising money for various Irish causes beginning in the early 1960s. She became a member of the Ladies Auxiliary of the Ancient Order of Hibernians in 1971, worked with the National Association for Irish Justice in 1969 and joined the County Cork Association in 1983, when women were first allowed to join. In 1989 she was appointed the association’s first female president.</p>
                        <p>Through her work with the Cork Association she became a founding leader of the Irish Immigration Reform Movement (IIRM), which grew out of a special meeting of the association in 1987. The IIRM was created in response to the problems faced by the 40,000 plus undocumented Irish immigrants who came to America in the 1980s. The IIRM was proactive in alerting the media, the American people, and legislators about the situation of these self-named New Irish, their legal status, and the obstacles they faced in America as undocumented aliens. They lobbied Congress to enact legislation that would provide visa relief for the Irish and immigrants from 35 other countries identified as “disadvantaged” by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>
                        <p>O’Driscoll was an integral part of the effort to pass HR-4300 in a dramatic 11th hour push in November 1990 that set aside 120,000 visas over three years for the Irish and the other designated disadvantaged immigrants. Of these 120,000, the Irish were entitled to 48,000 visas.</p>
                        <p>O’Driscoll was also involved in the opening of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center (EIIC) of Woodside, Queens, a social service offshoot of the IIRM. The EIIC provides day-to-day services to Irish and other immigrants in the community to help them transition to life in America. The EIIC offers practical advice to all immigrants such as how to open a bank account; obtain driver's licenses, housing, and medical insurance; advance their education or adjust their legal status.</p>
                        <p>O'Driscoll still serves as an active member of the Cork Association and a trustee and secretary of the executive committee of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center. She makes her home in Brooklyn, New York.</p>

                        <p>Rooney discussed the significant role that family and tradition plays in his life. He also discussed his ties to Mayo and Newry, Co. Down, Ireland. His great grandfather, Dan Rooney, and great grandmother Margaret Devlan, emigrated from Ireland to Wales via Prince Edward Island for 10 years, and then came to Coulter, Pa (outside of Pittsburgh) in the United States.</p>
                        <p>When the Rooney’s arrived in America, Jim’s great grandfather, Dan Rooney, a distinct leader in the 1st Ward of Pittsburgh’s North Side, opened a bar on Federal Street. The bar encapsulates the Rooney’s future business style in that it led to his grandfather’s introduction into professional boxing and sports as well as leading him into the position of 1st Ward Chairman on the North Side, which evolved his career into politics.</p>
                        <p>His grandfather, Art “The Chief” Rooney, was married to Kathleen McNulty in June of 1931 and had 5 children. He grew up and lived all his life in the North Side of Pittsburgh. He was an adamant sports fan and loved to gamble. He played minor league baseball from 1920-1925, and made the Olympic Boxing Team in 1920, but did not participate. He also played in many minor league football teams around Pittsburgh. Jim referred several times to his grandfather as a risk taker.</p>
                        <p>His maternal grandparents came to America from Ballaghaderreen, County Mayo, Ireland. Martin Reagan came in 1921 and sent for his wife Mary Duffy in 1923.2 of 10 kids grew up in Pittsburgh’s North Side, which he refers to as the Irish Ghetto in the turn of the 19th century. Rooney grew up there, too. His mom went to University of Pittsburgh later in life to gain the education that she had always wanted. His mom viewed vernaculars as an anathema, and had a ‘tough as nails’ personality that he asserts to the large family that she was in care of. His maternal grandmother is still alive today at the age of 96. Jim notes that his mother and grandmother are very similar in their tough personalities. He talked about the role his mother, Patricia Reagan, and his grandmother, Mary Duffy, played in his childhood. They emphasized education and compassion, while maintaining a ‘tough as nails’ demeanor. However he talks about his dad being the biggest influence in his adult life. He says this is because his dads inability to engage with a child. He discussed that his mother and father had met in the first grade and grew up together.</p>
                        <p>Dan Rooney, Jim Rooney’s father, was born 7-30-1932 on the North Side of Pittsburgh, PA and is the current owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers football team, which was passed down to him from his father Art “The Chief” Rooney in 1975. He was a member of the 1950 class at North Catholic High School and the 1955 class at Duquesne University. He is the Vice-Chairman of the American Ireland Fund, involved in The United Way of America, The American Diabetes Association, Presbyterian University Hospital, The Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation and Duquesne University. He is also the benefactor of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature, the founder of the Newry-Pittsburgh Partnership, and is the 3rd person to ever receive the Charter of Newry. He was also inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000.</p>
                        <p>He talks of his St. Bernard’s and Gilmour Academy Catholic School upbringing in St. Peter’s parish on the North Side of Pittsburgh, PA. Jim tells how his own kids have continued on, with the tradition of Catholic Schooling. He discusses the unique blend that Catholic school brings to a child’s education. He also talks of his ties to St. Peters Church near the Steelers stadium on the North Side of Pittsburgh and how everyone in his family has been baptized and married there and that he still goes to church there.</p>
                        <p>After his completion of college, he went to South Africa and worked with diabetic youth, which he says opened his eyes up to working with Ireland. In the mid 90’s, right after he got out of college, he went to Belfast to support his father’s efforts with the Ireland Fund. He was inspired by the immense economic growth that he witnessed from the first visit to Ireland in 1976 to his current visits in the 90’s, which motivated him to remain involved with efforts in Ireland.</p>
                        <p>A year after completing Boston College, Jim traveled to South America to work with diabetic youth. After this, in the mid-90’s Jim’s father, Dan Rooney, asked him to take up business dealings in Belfast to support his father’s work with the American Ireland Fund.</p>
                        <p>In 2001, he ran for state Senate as Democrat and lost, but has worked for many political campaigns. His wife steered him away from politics due to the stress and exposure in politics.</p>
                        <p>He talks about his five attempts at starting his own business, in which two have failed, one has been slightly successful and his current engagement is in progress. Part of his current business involved him in the creation of security robots called the ‘Kuchera Robots’ for the 2006 Super Bowl in Detroit as the director of First Link. The Kuchera Robot is a 30-pound robot that spins, crawls and looks through windows by remote control and takes photos; created for the use in Iraq, but used in the 2006 Super Bowl. First Link is in charge of marketing ideas, and works with Pantherlab Works to advance the technology in the ideas.</p>
                        <p>Jim Rooney was interviewed at New York University’s Glucksman Ireland House on November 9th 2006 by Amanda Snatchko and Marion Casey. The interview took place before Jim was scheduled to talk about his father and the Steelers tradition later that night at the Glucksman Ireland House as well.</p>

                        <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                        <p>James (Jim) E. Rooney (b. 1967 Pittsburgh, PA) is the son of Daniel M. Rooney (b. 1932) and Patricia Reagan, and the grandson of Arthur J. Rooney (1901-1988) and Kathleen McNulty (d. 1982). Art Rooney founded the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team in the Eastern division of the National Football League (NFL), in July of 1933 and turned its operations over to Dan Rooney in 1975, when Jim was eight years old. The Pittsburgh Steelers were the “Team of the Decade” during the 1970s, winning four Super Bowls (NFL Championships) in 1974, 1975, 1978, and 1979. Jim Rooney grew up in his grandfather’s house on North Lincoln Avenue on the North Side of Pittsburgh, not far from Three Rivers Stadium where, for most of his life, the Steelers played and the family business played out. In February 2006 the Pittsburgh Steelers, under the leadership of Jim’s oldest brother, Art Rooney II, won their fifth Super Bowl championship.</p>
                        <p>Fourth generation Irish on the Rooney side and second on the Reagan side, Jim Rooney grew up in a Catholic family that emphasized tradition and loyalty. By the time Jim was born in 1967, Daniel M. Rooney had achieved both success and prosperity in various sporting ventures and was able to give his nine children a very affluent standard of living. This was tempered, however, by the very pragmatic outlook of Jim's mother, Patricia Reagan, the daughter of immigrants from County Mayo, Ireland, who had emigrated to Pittsburgh in the early 1920s. The Rooneys were members of St. Peter's parish on the North Side, but Jim attended St. Bernard elementary school in Mt. Lebanon, a Pittsburgh suburb, and later Gilmour Academy near Cleveland, Ohio. He chose to break with family tradition, going to Boston College instead of Duquesne University, graduating with a degree in political science and communications in 1989.</p>
                        <p>After college, Jim Rooney was active in local Pittsburgh affairs including the city’s 1991 Childhood Lead Prevention Effectiveness study and its Planning Commission (1993-1996). He went to Belfast, Northern Ireland in the late 1990s to assist his father’s work with the American Ireland Fund. In 2001, he ran unsuccessfully for the Pennsylvania State Senate as a Democrat. At the time of this interview, Jim Rooney had been involved with the University of Pittsburgh’s Institute for Entrepreneurial Excellence in the Katz Graduate School of Business for five years and was director of its FirstLink center.</p>
                        <p>Married to Stephanie Blacksley, Jim Rooney is raising three children in a suburb of Pittsburgh.</p>

                        <p>Ryan discusses the neighborhood in which he grew up. He describes 1920’s Pelham Bay in the Bronx as farmland with fruit trees and gardens. He remembers his childhood as well as his family, specifically his mother and father, immigrants from Ireland who met in New York City. He discusses his Catholic upbringing and describes his parents’ reaction to his desire to be a priest; his mother’s delight and his father’s support.</p>
                        <p>After attending P.S. 71 for three years, Ryan attended the parish elementary school of Our Lady of Assumption after it opened in 1928, graduating in 1933. He continued his education at Cathedral College for high school and his first two years of college and then St. Joseph’s Seminary for the remainder of his college education and seminary training. He reveals his father’s belief that he should always pay his own way and because of his conviction, he would not allow Ryan to attend Seminary school on credit as the rest of the seminarians did.</p>
                        <p>On January 27, 1945 Gerald Ryan was ordained by Cardinal Francis Spellman (1889–1967). Twelve years after entering the seminary in a class of ninety-nine, sixteen were ordained. He discusses the changes in the Catholic Church and the seminary since his pre-Vatican II educational training, including the drop in numbers of young men with vocations.</p>
                        <p>While waiting for a position as an English teacher at Cardinal Hayes High School, Ryan was assigned to St. Anthony of Padua parish in the Bronx immediately after ordination. He discusses his adjustments to parish life in an African-American community and how he came interested in the civil rights movement. Ryan marched in Washington, DC and heard the famous “I Have a Dream” speech given by Dr. Martin Luther King in 1963, and two years later joined King and other religious leaders in Selma, Alabama to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in support of African-American voting rights. He describes the bus ride to Selma and the unknown fear of what could happen during the march. He tells the story of the angry southerners yelling at those participating in the protest and how the atmosphere changed once the crowd recognized singer Harry Belafonte in the line of marchers. Back in New York, Ryan continued to participate in demonstrations on issues affecting all poor communities such as housing and health.</p>
                        <p>Ryan served at St. Anthony’s until he was assigned as pastor of St. Luke’s parish in 1966. Several years later he learned that the call for a teaching position never came in 1945 because the pastor of St. Anthony’s had personally requested of the Cardinal that Ryan remain in the parish to work with him. Looking back, Ryan feels that remaining at St. Anthony’s instead of leaving to teach was for the best.</p>
                        <p>As pastor of St. Luke’s parish, Ryan ministers to a primarily Hispanic community. He discusses the differences in participation between his current parish and the primarily Irish parish he belonged to as a child. He tells of the current parishioners’ interest in participating in the liturgy and running of the parish. He speaks of the irony that as a young priest he served with three other priests in a parish and now as an older man he is the only priest in a bi-lingual parish. Ryan is currently the longest serving pastor in the diocese of New York. He spends his day running the parish with his other staff and administering to his parishioners’ needs. In addition to saying the majority of the masses at St. Luke’s, he works with the parish council and leads a weekly session for the troubled teens of the parish.</p>
                        <p>Ryan concludes the interview by discussing his opinions on the reasons for the lack of vocations to the priesthood and the loss of American Catholic faith. He speaks of his love for Ireland and in particular his special devotion to the Shrine of Our Lady of Knock in County Mayo.</p>
                        <p>Rev. Msgr. Gerald Ryan was interviewed at New York University’s Glucksman Ireland House on 17 November 2005 by Natalie Rose and Linda Dowling Almeida. This oral history with Msgr. Gerald Ryan was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 99 minutes long, on two CDs and had been logged at ten-minute intervals.</p>

                        <p>Monsignor Gerald J. Ryan, the sixth pastor of St. Luke’s Roman Catholic Church in New York’s South Bronx, was born on West 141st Street in Harlem, New York City in 1920. His mother, from Co. Limerick, worked as a cook before her marriage and his father, from Co. Tipperary, was a motorman on the IRT subway. The family moved to Pelham Bay in the east Bronx when Ryan, the fifth of six children, was two. There he attended P.S. 71 for three years (1925-1928), moving to the new parish school of Our Lady of the Assumption on Mahan Avenue to complete his elementary education in 1933. After graduating from Cathedral Preparatory High School and college, Ryan completed his education and seminary training at St. Joseph’s in Yonkers, New York.</p>
                        <p>Fr. Ryan was ordained on 27 January 1945 by Francis Cardinal Spellman. His first assignment was to St. Anthony of Padua, a primarily African-American parish located on East 166th Street in the Bronx, where he remained for the next twenty-one years. While there, Fr. Ryan became interested in the civil rights movement. He was in Washington, D.C. for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech on 28 August 1963 and also marched with King on several occasions, including in the voting rights demonstration on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, on 9 March 1965.</p>
                        <p>In 1966, Fr. Ryan was appointed pastor of St. Luke’s in the South Bronx (623 East 138th Street), which is where he was serving at the time of this interview. He succeeded Msgr. Robert B. Mulcahey, who had been pastor of St. Luke’s since 1931. By the late 1960s, the neighborhood that formed the parish of St. Luke’s, as well as other sections of the Bronx, was experiencing a major ethnic shift. The Irish and Italians who had been its principal residents were gradually replaced by Puerto Rican families. To make the necessary personal and professional adjustments, Fr. Ryan went to school to learn Spanish, and visited Spain and Puerto Rico. In the tough years of the 1970s, when the South Bronx was ravaged by drug addiction, crime, and decaying infrastructure, Fr. Ryan and dedicated parishioners renovated St. Luke’s for its 75th Anniversary in 1972 and converted the lower church into a desperately needed community center. He became a role model for local young people. “The young people, in turn, influenced Father Ryan; and, over time, his style of clothing, his long hair, his beard, reflected their styles, and became part of his St. Luke’s persona.”</p>
                        <p>In October 1995, after fifty years in the priesthood, Gerald Ryan was made a monsignor by John Cardinal O’Connor and two years later presided over the centennial celebrations for St. Luke’s, which was serving 600 families and 400 school-age children by 1997. At the time of this interview, Msgr. Ryan was 85 and still overseeing a majority of the masses at St. Luke’s, in addition to leading Wednesday night “rap” sessions for troubled teens in the parish and practicing Tai Chi regularly. He is the longest serving pastor in the Archdiocese of New York.</p>

                        <p>Eithne Golden Sax (b. 1919) is a retired multilingual translator for the United Nations, daughter of Irish nationalist organizer Peter Golden, and pupil of Irish republican author Ernie O’Malley.</p>

                        <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
                        <p>Eithne begins by talking about the family backgrounds of her parents, Peter Golden and Helen Merriam, who met while performing in 
                            <emph render="italic">A Comedy of Errors</emph> with Ben Greet’s Elizabethan Society of England. She recounts incidents from the family’s time in the Amsterdam Avenue apartment, such as visits by Irish nationalists like the poet Joseph Campbell (1879-1944) and Eamon De Valera as well as members of the Friends of Freedom for India. Purnendu Sinha apparently was admired for his ability to “carry the nappies in from the line so elegantly.” Eithne has only one clear memory of her father, when he tried to cure her earache with castor oil.</p>
                        <p>Eithne discusses her mother, Helen Merriam, in great depth, describing her as a “bohemian, a maverick,” and the “black sheep of the family.” She repeats a favorite anecdote from Christmas 1918 that her mother obviously relished telling the Golden children. She describes the family’s move to Pasadena, California, where Helen sold books at Brentano’s until Ernie O’Malley convinced the family to relocate to Taos, New Mexico in 1931.</p>
                        <p>In Taos, Eithne met various artists and local Pueblo Indians, even dancing with Thornton Wilder (1897-1975) at the home of Mabel Dodge Luhan (1879-1962). Alexandra Belkovitch (d. 1983), wife of painter Nicolai Fechin (1881-1955), taught her Russian lullabies that would later inspire her lifelong passion for foreign languages. Every day O’Malley tutored the Golden children and a local Mexican girl named Aurora in subjects ranging from grammar to geography; Eithne claims he called the Goldens the “stupidest children in the world” despite her fond memories of these sessions.</p>
                        <p>As a result, Eithne moved to New Jersey to live with friends while pursuing an opera career in New York City in 1938. Her beloved Aunt Pat, her father’s sister, greeted her at Pennsylvania Station, she recalls. But she quickly set her musical ambitions aside. By 1940, she moved to Lisbon, Portugal to work as a Foreign Service clerk, translating for the legation during World War II, she explains.</p>
                        <p>Eithne then discusses her time exploring the local music scene in Lisbon, which was cut short when she returned home to Taos to her ailing mother who was sick with cancer. After her mother’s death in 1943, Eithne moved to New York City’s East Village. She describes her experience working for a local group of Basque sympathizers, and she discusses a past love interest, Antonio Irela, the Secretary of the President of the Autonomous Basque Republic, Antón de Irala Basque government delegate to the United States</p>
                        <p>Eithne also touches upon her musical pursuits, as she co-founded the New York Society of Classical Guitar in 1946, as well as the Guitar Review magazine.</p>
                        <p>In the next part of the interview, Eithne describes her experience working for the United Nations as a translator beginning in 1949. She met her future husband, Ernie Sax, at a United Nations party in 1956, and admits that she thought Sax was a snob after their first meeting and that he “looked down on us girls.” But a few weeks later, when Sax was hospitalized after a car accident, she visited him in the hospital, which Eithne claims was the start of a “great love affair.” Eithne and Ernie Sax married that same year.</p>
                        <p>In the small remainder of the interview, Eithne explores the idea of Irish identity, and she discusses her trip to Ireland in 1959. Eithne describes her life after her husband’s death in 1969, and details her current pursuits, explaining that she takes Irish language classes and attends events at the Glucksman Ireland House. Finally, Eithne explains that she is currently writing her memoirs.</p>
                        <p>Eithne Merriam Golden Sax was interviewed on 2 November 2006 at her home on in New York City’s upper east side by Elizabeth Bedell and Marion R. Casey. This oral history with Eithne Merriam Golden Sax was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 140 minutes long, on two CDs and has been logged at ten-minute intervals.</p>

                        <p>Sexton provides detailed information primarily on his youth and family life, from 1942 to 1975. Sexton’s grandfather, James J. Sexton (1875-1947), was born in County Sligo (near the border with Donegal), Ireland, the son of the village blacksmith. He came to the United States at the age of 20 and settled in Brooklyn, New York, where he worked as a blacksmith and became an active member and eventual president of the International Union of Journeymen Horseshoers. James Sexton entered local politics in 1915 as Democratic District leader in the Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and by 1929 was serving Mayor James J. Walker as President of the New York City Board of Taxes and Assessments. Sexton gives an example of his grandfather’s character and influence during the Depression while head of Brooklyn’s Jefferson Democratic Club.</p>
                        <p>Sexton’s father, John E. Sexton, a graduate of Manhattan College and Fordham University Law School, died in 1960 when his son was eighteen, after years battling the effects of alcoholism. He discusses the good and bad experiences he had as a child, including hardships resulting from the chronic ill health of his father. Sexton describes how his father taught him the value of helping other people by bringing home what Sexton refers to as “handymen.” Rather than renting out the extra room in their house, Sexton’s father would take in homeless men who were frequently recovering alcoholics and allow them to stay until they got back on their feet. Sexton acknowledges the centrality of his relationship with his father to subsequent choices he made in life, and briefly talks about his strained relationship with his uncle Jim Sexton. He attributes his knowledge of his Irish heritage to his aunt Ruth Sexton (Sr. James Marie), a Dominican nun.</p>
                        <p>While remaining closest to his mother’s German family, Sexton personally identifies himself as Irish. He talks about the pastor-like persona of all the Sexton men in his family and how readily it translates to his current position as President of New York University and Dean of its Law School before that. Sexton attributes this love of people to being Irish and says this was passed down to him by his father. Although he refers throughout the interview to the NYU Law School as his “parish” and the university as his “archdiocese,” Sexton does not otherwise agree with the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. He discusses his personal concept of Catholicism and his relationship with the Church, reflecting on the Jewish identity of his wife, children and grandchildren.</p>
                        <p>He describes his education and work experience, especially his time at Fordham University and St. Francis College. Following his father’s death, Sexton began coaching a debate team at St. Brendan’s Diocesan High School for girls where his sister was enrolled. He talks extensively about the fifteen years he spent with the debate team, the significance of the experience both for him and for the girls he coached, and describes the first reunion the team had recently. He credits one of his teachers at Brooklyn Prep, Charlie Winans, with being the inspiration behind his efforts with the St. Brendan’s debaters. He recounts how his first application to Harvard Law School was rejected and how his friend, Lawrence Tribe, called in a few favors, convincing the admissions department to give his application reconsideration; nevertheless, Sexton’s commitment to St. Brendan’s was so great that he deferred going to law school until 1975.</p>
                        <p>Fifty-three minutes into this oral history, Edward C. Smith, general auditor and senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, arrives for a meeting and Sexton invites him to listen in on the remainder of the interview. He asks Smith if there is a demonstration outside, which is a reference to the rally organized by the United Auto Workers in support of striking NYU graduate assistants that was scheduled for noon that day outside Bobst Library. This is the second brief reference Sexton makes to the strike during this interview.</p>
                        <p>John E. Sexton was interviewed in his academic office in Vanderbilt Hall at New York University School of Law on 2 December 2005 by Shawna C. Meechan and Marion R. Casey. This oral history with John E. Sexton was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. Interview is 71 minutes, 56 seconds long, on two CDs and had been logged at ten minute intervals.</p>

                        <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                        <p>John Edward Sexton was born on 29 September 1942 at Peck Memorial Hospital in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York, the eldest child of John Edward Sexton (1904-1960), a lawyer, and Catherine Humann Sexton (d.1980). His grandfather, James J. Sexton (1875-1947), a Brooklyn Democratic district leader, emigrated from Ireland at age twenty.</p>
                        <p>After attending Catholic schools in Belle Harbor, Queens (St. Francis De Sales) and in Crown Heights, Brooklyn (Brooklyn Preparatory High School), John Sexton went to Fordham University on a full scholarship. There he earned a Bachelor of Arts in History (1963); a Master of Arts in Comparative Religion (1965); and a Ph.D. in the History of American Religion (1978), encouraged by Rev. Timothy Healey, S.J. While finishing his degrees at Fordham, Sexton taught Religion at St. Francis College in Brooklyn from 1966-1975, serving as department chair from 1970–1975. In his thirties, Sexton made a career change, enrolling in Harvard Law School from which he received his Juris Doctorate magna cum laude in 1979.</p>
                        <p>Between 1960 and 1975, John Sexton also initiated and coached a debate team at St. Brendan’s Diocesan High School, an all girl Catholic secondary school in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. The St. Brendan’s team won five Interscholastic National Debate Championships during those fifteen years, for which Sexton was later named “Outstanding High School Debate Coach of the last 50 Years” by Emory University, sponsor of the Barkley Forum for High Schools.</p>
                        <p>After graduating from Harvard, Sexton clerked for United States Court of Appeals judges David Bazelon (1909-1993) and Harold Leventhal (1915-1979) and for Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger (1907-1995). He then returned to academics in 1981 when he joined the faculty of New York University School of Law; seven years later, he was appointed its Dean. In 2002 Sexton became the fifteenth president of New York University. Simultaneously he is Benjamin Butler Professor of Law at NYU, continuing to teach and foster connections with students and fellow faculty.</p>
                        <p>Appointed Special Master, Sexton supervised pretrial proceedings in the Love Canal litigation (1983-1993), an historic environmental pollution case with federal and state ramifications that pitted residents of the City of Niagara Falls, New York against Occidental Chemical Corporation. Sexton is the co-author of Redefining the Supreme Court’s Role: A Theory of Managing the Federal Court System (Yale University Press, 1986), which focuses on the selection process for cases to the highest court in the United States, as well as the widely used textbook Civil Procedure: Cases and Materials (West Publishing Company, 2001).</p>
                        <p>In addition to his responsibilities at NYU, Sexton is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of both the Association of American University Professors and the Council on Foreign Relations. He was founding Chairman of the Board of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) Dispute Resolution, Inc. in 2000 and at the time of this interview was serving as Chairman of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Fordham University, St. Francis College, and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven have conferred honorary degrees on him.</p>
                        <p>John E. Sexton is married to Lisa Ellen Goldberg, President of the Charles Revson Foundation, whom he met at Harvard Law School. They have a son, John Edward Sexton III (Jed), and a daughter, Katie Sexton.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Shanley discusses a range of topics, focusing particularly on his success in the writing world, both in theater and film, as well as his Irish background and identity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Shanley begins by discussing his childhood in the Bronx, and the difficulties he had in school because of his “differences.” He describes feeling misunderstood because of his creativity, particularly by his father, who, as a survivor of the Great Depression, wanted Shanley to pursue a career with security and a pension. Shanley’s difficulties in school manifested themselves as behavioral issues which resulted in hours of detention over the course of his academic career. He was asked to leave several schools before a teacher at his New Hampshire boarding school took him under his wing and ensured that he graduated.</p>
                        <p>Shanley describes his career at New York University and the way in which a five year leave from academia after high school helped his education. He explains how his two year stint in the Marine Corps in the middle of the Vietnam War provided him with the insight to negotiate institutional structures for his personal benefit, rather than battle against them. Shanley credits the discipline of the Marines for his success at NYU, from which he graduated as valedictorian of his class in 1977.</p>
                        <p>Much of Shanley’s best known work focuses on individuals struggling within institutional structures, particularly 
                            <emph render="italic">Doubt</emph>, which Shanley based on his experiences in religious-based institutions. He identifies the inspiration for 
                            <emph render="italic">Doubt</emph> as emerging from his own philosophy on life -- which advocates sticking to his convictions, regardless of his certainty in their correctness -- and draws on some of his school experiences, particularly his primary school, St. Anthony’s, which was run by the Sisters of Charity. His first grade teacher was the model for the character of Sister James in the play. Shanley later hired her as a consultant on the movie version of the play, which premiered in 2008.</p>
                        <p>
                            <emph render="italic">Doubt</emph> has garnered multiple awards for Shanley, including a 2005 Tony for best play and the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Shanley was also the recipient of an Oscar for best original screenplay for the movie 
                            <emph render="italic">Moonstruck</emph>, a 1987 film that focused on the convoluted love life of an Italian American played by Cher. During the interview he focuses largely on the evolution of his career. He discusses life experience as it relates to his success, as well as persistence -- at one point, he was living below the poverty line and working a series of odd jobs, but still producing about one play a year.</p>
                        <p>Shanley talks about his two adopted sons from his first marriage who come from very diverse ethnic backgrounds. Shanley does not consider ethnicity an integral part of their upbringing, and refers to his own Irishness as being a literal part of him, rather than something that derives from his own social or cultural upbringing. He does, however, credit his Irish background for his ability to tell a story, saying that a visit to his family’s farm in Ireland made him realize how like his Irish relatives he was—finally finding a niche after years of feeling “different” and “weird.”</p>
                        <p>John Patrick Shanley was interviewed on 5 November 2008 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Mary Catherine Williamson and Linda Dowling Almeida. This oral history with John Patrick Shanley was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. Interview is 1 hr, 22 minutes long, on 2 CDs and has been logged at 10 minute intervals.</p>

                        <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                        <p>John Patrick Shanley was born on 13 October 1950 in the Bronx, New York City. His father, Nicholas, originally from County Westmeath in Ireland, worked with Swift and Company for over thirty years. His mother, Frances, was a second generation ethnic whose parents emigrated from Tipperary, Ireland. The youngest of five children, Shanley grew up in the East Tremont section of the Bronx, a low income neighborhood plagued by drug addiction and violence through the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
                        <p>Shanley began his education in traditional Catholic primary schools, first at St. Helena’s on Benedict Avenue in the Bronx and then at St. Anthony’s in East Tremont. He then began high school at the all-boys Cardinal Spellman, where his problems with the rigid academic and disciplinary system led to a rebellious year and a half. Shanley spent nearly every afternoon in detention, after which he was asked to leave the school. His time at Cardinal Spellman was not completely wasted, however, for it was there he had his first experience in the theater, working on the school’s production of 
                            <emph render="italic">Cyrano de Bergera</emph>c. Shanley finished his high school education at a private boarding school in New Hampshire. It was there Shanley began flourishing as a writer, experimenting with poetry and story writing with the encouragement of his teachers.</p>
                        <p>After Shanley graduated high school he started studying at New York University, but dropped out after one semester due to poor grades. After hearing from multiple sources that it was the branch of the service that was the least “boring,” Shanley enlisted in the Marine Corps and served from 1970 to 1972. Though his service was during the Vietnam War, Shanley was never sent to fight, instead he was stationed for training in Panama, Guantanamo Bay, and Camp Lejeune. After his discharge, Shanley spent time working odd jobs, but when his wife encouraged him to finish school, Shanley returned to NYU. The discipline Shanley had learned in the Marines allowed him to flourish in his final years at the college. In 1977, Shanley graduated as valedictorian of his class. While at NYU, Shanley had focused his writing skills on crafting dialogue. His final project for his Intro to Playwriting course, 
                            <emph render="italic">The Baptism of Rose Maroon</emph>, was produced at NYU a few weeks after it was written. Shanley’s father, who had lived through the Great Depression, did not support Shanley’s artistic interests and encouraged Shanley to get a “real” job, i.e., one that would provide security and a pension. But Shanley continued to write. His plays were consistently produced and only rarely recognized by the press. His choice forced him to find work as an elevator operator, house painter, furniture mover, locksmith, bartender, and sandwich maker to make ends meet. In the early 1980s, however, Shanley was awarded the National Endowment for the Arts grant for playwriting, freeing him from dependence on odd jobs and allowing him to focus solely on his art. His first screenplay, 
                            <emph render="italic">Five Corners</emph>, captured the attention of George Harrison and the ex-Beatle provided the funding to make it into a film.</p>
                        <p>Sally Field then contacted Shanley and asked him to write a project for her. He penned a screenplay titled 
                            <emph render="italic">The Bride and the Beast</emph> that went on to become the critically acclaimed 
                            <emph render="italic">Moonstruck</emph> (1987), which won four Academy Awards, including one to Shanley for Best Original Screenplay one to Cher for Best Actress. His next two screenwriting ventures, 
                            <emph render="italic">The January Man</emph> (1989) and 
                            <emph render="italic">Joe vs. the Volcano</emph> (1990) -- the first film Shanley both wrote and directed -- were less well received. During this time, Shanley continued to write plays for the stage as well as scripts for the screen.</p>
                        <p>In 2004, Shanley premiered the play 
                            <emph render="italic">Doubt: A Parable </emph>off-Broadway at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The work focused on a Catholic priest suspected of abusing a young boy. The play earned Shanley outstanding reviews, and took home four Tony awards for the 2004-2005 season, including Best Play. A film adaptation written and directed by Shanley and featuring Oscar winner Meryl Streep premiered in 2008. It earned Academy Award nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay for Shanley, Best Actress for Meryl Streep, Best Supporting Actor for Philip Seymour Hoffman and Best Supporting Actress for both Amy Adams and Viola Davis. Shanley has undergone multiple surgeries for advanced glaucoma, to which he has lost 50% of his eyesight. Shanley did not allow his condition to stand in the way of his work, though—some days would find him directing in the morning and under the surgeon’s knife in the afternoon.</p>
                        <p>He is the father of two boys, Nick and Frank, adopted with his former wife and named for his parents. Shanley and his wife paid for the prenatal care for two young women due within months of one another, assuming one would change her mind about giving the child up for adoption. Neither did.</p>
                        <p>Shanley’s 23 plays have been produced in 15 languages on stages in 17 countries, with roughly 80 productions a year in the United States and Canada. He resides in New York’s Gramercy Park neighborhood and is working on the third part of a trilogy examining the power of institutions that began with 
                            <emph render="italic">Doubt</emph> and 2005’s 
                            <emph render="italic">Defiance</emph>, a play which focuses on racial tensions in the military during the Vietnam War.</p>

                        <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
                        <p>Tommy Smyth was born in Knockbridge, County Louth, Ireland, on 19 December 1945. Growing up Mr. Smyth attended his local public school, Knockbridge National School. After graduating he attended technical school at Dundalk Institute of Technology for two years. Mr. Smyth played Gaelic Football for his local team in Knockbridge. Although it was forbidden by the governing body of Gaelic Football, the Gaelic Athletic Association, he also attended many soccer matches and developed a deep love for soccer. Prior to emigrating from Ireland, Mr. Smyth worked in a steel foundry for Dalgan Steel Founders.</p>
                        <p>When he was young Mr. Smyth's Aunt Minnie, who lived in America, would come back to Ireland every year. This was very unusual at the time as Irish immigrants to the United States typically did not return home. Minnie was also one of twenty children on his mother's side. On one of her visits, Mr. Smyth decided that he would go back to America with her. Thus, Mr. Smyth immigrated to America on 3 August 1963, when he was 17 years old, with the promise to his parents that he would come back to Ireland in two years. For the next two decades Mr. Smyth would continue this cyclical migration pattern and come to America for a two year period, followed by a return to Ireland. This stopped when Mr. Smyth's mother passed away in the early 1980s and he decided to remain in America for good.</p>
                        <p>This atypical immigration path caused problems for Mr. Smyth with his employers, as every two years he would have to quit his current job. When he came back to America for another two year period, he would have to find a new job. He started working in America as an electrician's helper and held various other positions such as maintenance man, cold storage snow shoveler, a position in a trucking company, and eventually house painter, which he did for about 17 years before being hired by ESPN.</p>
                        <p>In 1990 Mr. Smyth got his first big break in the media. In March of that year, he was interviewed for 15 minutes by Jack O'Hara and Andrea McCarren on WNBC-NY television about the Gaelic Games during the station’s broadcast of the St. Patrick’s Day Parade. For the next couple of years he called the producers of the broadcast asking for work with the parade. Finally, in 1993, Mr. Smyth was hired as a researcher for the parade by David Maher. Eventually Mr. Maher told Mr. Smyth that he knew too much about Ireland not to be on the broadcast. So in 1993, Mr. Smyth became a co-host of the St. Patrick's Day Parade. He says this was a life goal of his and it took him 17 years of bothering people in subtle ways, but he achieved it.</p>
                        <p>In 1993, Mr. Smyth also joined ESPN as a soccer analyst, but still painted houses on the side. In 1994, he was hired to announce some games for the 1994 World Cup for ESPN. On the Friday before the game Mr. Smyth was painting a house on Long Island. Over the weekend he announced Argentina vs. Nigeria at Foxboro Stadium in Massachusetts, and then returned to painting the house on Monday, much to the surprise of the house's owner, who had express skepticism about his weekend assignment.</p>
                        <p>While at ESPN Mr. Smyth has called the last two World Cups, World Cup qualifying matches, Union of European Football Associations Champions League, and Italian Serie ‘A.’ Aside from these premier events, Mr. Smyth has called over 2,000 international matches from soccer leagues in Brazil to Holland and has been seen in over 200 countries via ESPN International. Mr. Smyth broadcasts other sporting events for ESPN as well, including horse racing, harness racing, and Gaelic Games. He was also the voice of Major League Soccer’s New York Metro Stars from the team’s debut in 1996 until the early 2000s.</p>
                        <p>In 2008, Mr. Smyth was tapped to be the Grand Marshall of the New York St. Patrick's Day parade. He had been a co-host covering the parade for WNBC-4 in New York City since 1993. Known as the “people's Grand Marshall,” he is viewed as one of the most popular Grand Marshalls of all time. Mr. Smyth made it a point to attend all of the dances and dinners before the parade, and is the only person in parade history to have led the parade as the Grand Marshall and then returned in line to march with his home county contingent on the same day. Mr. Smyth is currently married to Treasa Smyth. They have two children, Anthony, 23, who was born in Cork and Lisa, 22, who was born in America. He plans on staying in America long-term but wants to be buried in his hometown of Knockbridge in Ireland.</p>

                        <p>Smyth opens the interview talking about her childhood, starting with her mother’s pregnancy with her and her twin sister. She discusses the experiences of growing up with ten siblings who all lived under one roof in an old farmhouse. She describes her mom cooking on a hearth fireplace and the sleeping arrangements in her house. She remembers her mother as a fantastic cook, making delicious dishes with simple resources and how her mother would make Treasa gather the wood in the morning to start the fire in the hearth. She recalls selling the vegetables they raised on the farm and milking cows and talks about wearing rubber boots, or wellies, when farming. She admits surprise when she sees people wearing them today as fashionable footwear. She remembers how her dog Scotty would help her with the daily chores and talks about watching TV shows like Eurovision, Flipper, and Skippy the Kangaroo.</p>
                        <p>She remembers her dad’s passing and seeing a banshee that night, and knowing it was a sign that her dad had died. After her father’s death all her siblings had to help maintain the farm. She recalls with sadness that some of her dad’s customers did not pay their bills after his death and how that disturbed her because of his fairness to them while he was alive.</p>
                        <p>She talks about the importance of religion in her family. Her parents did not tolerate distractions or disruptions during their daily prayers and every Saturday her family went to confession. She recalls her first confession and how she could not think up a sin, so a nun told her to make one up.</p>
                        <p>She talks about going to school at Saint Mary’s National School in Cobh and describes how the nuns were very mean to her and how in one incident a nun did not let her use the bathroom. She felt the nuns were biased against her and her siblings because they were poor and from the country and made them clean up after the rich city girls. She also recalls a funny story about having to choose between getting in trouble with her sister or a nun. She talks about being forced to learn Irish in school without much success, but that at 17 she decided to really take an interest in the language and got a scholarship to study it at summer school. She recalls her choice to continue her studies at the vocational school rather than continue with the nuns. At vocational school she started to fall in love with learning as she acquired very practical skills like accounting and wood work. She also talks about one teacher whom she admired who played camogie.</p>
                        <p>She recalls growing up playing sports and listening to games on the radio. She talks about her mom’s disapproval of girls playing sports and that she had to sneak out of the house to try out for the camogie team, only to break her ankle at the tryout. On her second attempt she made the national team but managed to hide it from her mother. She remembers that her mother finally accepted her athletic pursuits later on in her life. She also talks about the importance of the sport to her even in America and how she would help other players of the game immigrate to the US.</p>
                        <p>She describes going to Gurteen Agriculture College to study farm management and how she was one of the only women at the school. She remembers not being treated well by her male peers. During her apprenticeship she performed a job that required three men to complete when she left. Smyth chats about working in pig management and her job on a pig farm supervising 10 men. She remembers how she had to work carefully with all the men to make them feel comfortable as members of a team and ultimately winning their respect and allegiance.</p>
                        <p>She talks about her first experience giving birth in Ireland, how she was kept in the dark about what was going to happen and where the baby would come from. She talks about the privacy in her household and the reluctance to share intimate information. She compares it to Ireland today and how more open the culture is and that people talk a little too much about their lives now.</p>
                        <p>Treasa describes coming to America for the first time and observing the degree of its diversity with some surprise. She discusses her early jobs as a domestic and how it was hard for her to make ends meet as a single mother. She talks about becoming a nurse and how at first she resisted the idea because she thought nurses were arrogant, but finally decided to go to night school. It took her four years to complete her degree. She talks about finding her social network by playing camogie at Gaelic Park and the importance of immigrants helping each other when they arrive through sports and other outlets. She also talks about being an undocumented alien. Treasa talks about her mom dying and how her mother waited to pass until Treasa was back in Ireland. She recalls having a vision of her father, who was dead, holding her mother’s hand as her mom died. She talks about the funeral and explains how Tommy Smyth, her husband, supported her during that time. She talks about how she met Smyth, an ESPN soccer analyst, and their 12 year courtship. Treasa talks about her faith and how Mass for her is the beginning of a new week. She talks about raising her kids in the Catholic Church.</p>
                        <p>She says her children identify themselves as Americans even though every summer Treasa sent them to Ireland to stay with family and experience life on the farm with their Irish relatives. She ends the interview describing how she is an Irish person in her heart but she loves America.</p>
                        <p>This oral history with Treasa Goodwin Smyth was digitally recorded on Marantz CDR420. The interview is 2 hours and 23 minutes. The interview took place on November 6, 2009, and the interviewers were Alexia Townsend and Linda Dowling Almeida.</p>

                        <p>Treasa Goodwin Smyth was born in 1960 in Ireland. She is a twin. Her mother is from Tallow, County Wexford, Ireland, and worked as a cook for a few years before marrying her father, a farmer from Cobh, County Cork. Treasa was born and raised on a farm and falls in the middle of ten siblings. Her father died when she was 12. When in college she developed a passion for playing camogie, an Irish variation of lacrosse, and made it to the Irish national team. She later received an academic scholarship to Gurteen Agriculture College and was the first young woman from her county to earn a scholarship to study farm management. During her studies, she faced resistance and discrimination from her male peers and some superiors because so few women were in the field. She moved to the United States in the 1980s after giving birth to her son. She has two children. Her daughter was born in the US. When Treasa first migrated she worked as a maid before attending night school for nursing.
