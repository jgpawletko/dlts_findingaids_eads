First donation: seven handwritten World War II era letters. Five are from George Watt, then in the US Army; three of these are to Milt Wolff. Two letters are about George Watt. Also included is a page proof of Watt's book   (1990). Second donation (Dec. 2004): c. 300 letters written by George Watt during World War II to his wife, Margaret Watt.

            <p>From an early age, George Watt (b. 1913) was involved in Communist activities, serving as executive secretary of the Communist National Student League. From 1937-1939, he was a political commissar in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War. Watt later served as a sergeant in the Army Air Force during World War II.</p>
            <p>After the war, Watt became an official of the American Communist Party. He was one of a group of party officers convicted of sedition in 1953 (the conviction was overturned on appeal). Watt broke with the Communist Party in 1958. He died in 1994 at age 80.</p>
