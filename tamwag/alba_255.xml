            <p>John ("Jack") Harley Yellin (August 15, 1913-April 28, 1972), served as a volunteer on the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War. He arrived in Spain on January 1, 1937 and joined the International Brigades (probably the Lincoln Battalion of the Fifteenth International Brigrade, or possibly in the Thirteenth--Jaroslav Dombrowski Polish--International Brigade, First Battalion), where he worked as a automobile mechanic and driver. He served at Cordoba and Brunete, and was wounded in action on July 23, 1937. He returned to the United States after July of 1938. Yellin was born in Connecticut; he was an architect and a draftsman. He also served in the United States Navy during World War II (from April 1944-December 1945), as radar mechanic.</p>
