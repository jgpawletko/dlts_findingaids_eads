            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>This collection consists of ca. 300 black and white, 35mm slides; the images are of Spanish Civil War-era Spain and include scenes of wartime destruction, refugees, street and battlefield scenes, a bullfight, and village life. There are also a few shots of naval vessels on the coast of North Africa and a few images of snowy mountains. The many shots of Nationalist troops, Spanish officials, and individuals in German uniform suggest that the photographs might have been taken by a German visitor, touring Spain toward the end of, or just after, the Civil War. The slides were the property of Eric Muller, a professional photographer from Lynn, MA, who got them from a returning U.S. serviceman who had served in Europe in World War II.</p>
