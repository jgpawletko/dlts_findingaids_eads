            <p>John B. Andrews (1880-1943) was a labor historian, secretary of the American Association for Labor Legislation (1905-1942), and author. He studied at the University of Wisconson (B.A. 1904). He founded and edited the 
                <emph render="italic">American Labor Legislation Review</emph>, authored 
                <emph render="italic">Documentory History of Industrial Democracy</emph>, Vol. IX and X (1910-1911), 
                <emph render="italic">Principles of Legislation</emph> (1916), 
                <emph render="italic">History of Labor in the United States</emph> (1918), and numerous government reports. These notes were used to write Volumes IX and X, "Labor Movement, 1860-1880", of Documentary History of Industrial Democracy. Most of the notes were compiled from labor newspapers, interviews with former union members, and secondary sources. They reflect the organizing efforts and concerns of the early unions. Other materials include a Ph.D. exam given to Andrews and Helen Sumner (1908), newspaper articles, outlines, and correspondence. Series descriptions follow (note that series 6 constitutes the bulk of the collection).</p>
