In 1927, he moved to Wisconsin to become the executive director of the Federated Jewish Charities of Milwaukee. During this time, he was very active in the Wisconsin Conference of Social Work and helped to write child welfare legislation. From 1932-1943, he was appointed superintendent of the Department of Outdoor Relief. For five months in 1934, he left to work for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. In 1943, he left Milwaukee and joined the Public Housing Administration. With the exception of a brief period during 1943 and 1944 when he served as a displaced persons officer in Europe with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, he worked on housing issues until his death in 1953. eanette Glassberg was involved in the women's suffrage movement in Washington D.C. where she grew up and attended George Washington University.
