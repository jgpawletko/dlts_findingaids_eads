            <p>George Caylor (1885-1973), born George N. Cohen, was a socialist, writer, labor arbitrator, businessman, and brother of labor leader Joseph E. Cohen (1883-1950). Caylor compiled sketches of socialist and labor figures including Debs, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, John Spargo, Frances Perkins, Jack London, Emmanuel Haldeman-Julius and Bettina Borman Wells. Caylor's other writings dealt with labor, socialism and racial justice. In his autobiography, 
                <title render="italic">If My Memory Serves Me Right</title>, he writes of his early years in Philadelphia, the socialist movement, the single-tax community of Arden, Delaware and the Rand School, as well as of such individuals as Hillquit, Frances Perkins, Rose Schneiderman, Pauline Newman and others. Caylor also wrote a series of letters to the Orlando Sentinel on political and social issues which he then used as the basis of a seminar at Rollins College, in Florida, in 1958.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The bulk of the images that make up this collection are oversize photocopies of large pages from a family photograph album (also included are negative photocopies of the pages as well), a handful of black and white images (snapshots and one negative photocopy), dates ranging from 1914 to 1948. Most of the images are traditional family album portraits and informal snapshots (including views of family and friends at Arden and several portraits and snapshots of Joseph Cohen). In addition, there are also a number of shots of meetings of organizations. Included are an International Labour Organization meeting in Geneva, Switzerland,in 1938; Social Security Board Federal Advisory Council for Employment Security meeting, 1942; Seminar Workmen's Compensation, Toronto 1946, and Testimonial Dinner, International Typographical Union, Local 2, 1941. Group portraits provide important documentation for the Socialist Party of Pennsylvania - the Socialist State Convention, Reading, Pa, 1930; the Socialist Convention, Harrisburg, 1909; the Pennsylvania delegation to the national Socialist Convention, 1912, and the Philadelphia delegation to the state convention, in Harrisburg, 1932. In addition there is a snapshot of Joe Cohen with the Pennsylvania socialist, James Maurer. Of particular interest is a snapshot of Aaron Berkman of Philadelphia, Charlie Chaplin, and Upton Sinclair (date unknown, although it appears to be pre-1920s, place unknown also).</p>
