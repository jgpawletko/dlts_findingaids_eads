            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>Most of the files in this collection relate to two components of May Chen’s work as a labor organizer and community activist in the New York's Chinatown from 1989 to 2005. The first component is organizing Chinese immigrant garment workers to fight sweatshop conditions. These files contain newspaper clippings, logistic planning documents, meeting notes, contact lists, press releases, flyers and memos for UNITE’s Chinatown Rally to Stop Sweatshops on August 28, 1998. The other component of Chen’s collection consists of advocacy work to aid Chinatown’s economic recovery after 9/11. These files include reports and conference materials relating to a variety of organizations, for example, Asian Americans for Equality’s Rebuild Chinatown Initiative, the Asian American Federation’s economic impact study of Chinatown after Sept 11th, and the Asian American Leadership Conference, "Healing and Rebuilding in New York," held on May 10, 2002. In addition, there are materials relating to Chen’s work as a founding member and executive officer of the Asian-Pacific American Labor Alliance (APALA); these include a constitution and chapter by-laws, an application for tax exempt status, contact mailing lists, an executive board directory, and a directory of Asian-American organizations in New York and California. A preliminary inventory of the first five boxes is available on request.</p>
