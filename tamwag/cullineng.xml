            <p>George Cullinen (1912-2003) was born in San Francisco and graduated from NYU. After serving in Spain he became a maritime captain, and, with his wife Sonia operated a progressive elementary school in Queens, NY. After retiring to Vermont he developed an interest in film and made several documentaries, including the prize-winning "Washington to Moscow." The collection consists of four files of miscellaneous correspondence, clippings, flyers and mailings from VALB and other organizations (including some material from Spain). The material is mostly from the 1980s and 90s and documents George Cullinen's continuing interest in issues of labor, civil rights, and world peace. One file contains material dealing with his interest in maritime labor history, including clippings on Harry Bridges and photocopies of his writings in  , the newsletter of the Marine Workers Historical Association. Also included is a videotape of a presentation on his experience in Spain at Suffolk University, Boston, on March 21, 2000, and a typescript memoir by Cullinen(later published). The collection also includes a Spanish Civil War-era note from the Socorro Rojo Internacional, thanking Cullinen for a donation of food items.</p>
