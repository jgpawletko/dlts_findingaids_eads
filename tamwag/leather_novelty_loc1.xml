            <p>Pocketbook Workers Local 1 was organized in 1886 and the national union with which it had stormy relations had its antecedents in the upsurge of organization among Jewish needle trade workers in the decade following 1910. A 1916 general strike of leather goods workers resulted in the first signed contract with the New York Leather Goods Manufacturers Association in August 1918. Originally affiliated with the United Hebrew Trades, the local obtained a charter from the AFL as Federal Labor Union no. 17873 in 1926 and in 1937 as the International Ladies' Handbag, Pocketbook and Novelty Workers Union. A skilled workforce of Jewish and Italian craftsmen working for such manufacturers as Coach Leather, as well as smaller novelty shops, has seen the introduction of Puerto Ricans and African-Americans. Due to the exporting of jobs to lower-wage countries, most recently China, many New York City shops have closed. In 1992, Local 1 merged with United Food and Commercial Workers Local 342-50.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The records of Local 1 are incomplete. Included in the collection are Executive Board minutes, 1968-1981; membership minutes, 1968-1977; negotiation and arbitration files from the 1970s; assorted newsletters, contracts, anniversary journals, and correspondence, mostly from the presidency of Domenic Di Paola. Two linear feet of photographs, most of them ceremonial and dating from the 1930s through the 1980s, have been transferred to the Nonprint Department. The Wagner Labor Archives also holds oral history interviews with Domenic Di Paola and Rita Polter, a union activist since the 1930s.</p>
