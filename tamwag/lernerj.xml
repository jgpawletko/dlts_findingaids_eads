            <p>James Lerner (b. 1911) traveled to Spain as a young journalist during the Spanish Civil War. He participated in a National Youth Congress in Milwaukee in 1940 and went on to become an editor and photographer for the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America's newspaper,

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>Papers contain drafts of Lerner's autobiographical memoir, magazines with writings by Lerner, related clippings, UE flyers and pamphlets, Lerner's High School yearbook (1927) signed by his fellow students, and student peace congress flyers from the 1930s. In addition, materials include records of Lerner's 1930 arrest in Washington, DC for protesting, correspondence documenting student peace movements of the 1930s, and other correspondence written during and after Lerner's school days in the 1930s. The papers include materials on Fred Wright, a cartoonist for the UE. Also included is a box of oversized print materials related to Lerner's travels and to UE activity and meetings. The materials also include books, artifacts, and 3.5" floppy disks. Box 5 includes letters written by Lerner to his wife from various places across the U.S., that include detailed descriptions of his union organizing and political work in those areas (1933-1938). Two binders of photonegatives, chiefly from Lerner's travels abroad in the 1970s, but also from UE conventions, have been separated to the Library's nonprint collection (Photos 277).</p>
