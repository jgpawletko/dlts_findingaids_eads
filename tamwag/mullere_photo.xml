            <p>This collection consists of 300 black and white, 35mm slides of views of Spain and includes images of wartime destruction, refugees, street and battlefield scenes, a bullfight and village life. There are also a few shots of naval vessels on the coast of North Africa and a few images of snowy mountains, possibly in the Alps. Many shots of fascist troops, Spanish officials and individuals in German uniform suggest that the photographs might have been taken by a German visitor, touring Spain toward the end of, or just after, the Spanish Civil War. The slides were the property of Eric Muller, himself a photographer, who served with the U.S. forces in Germany in World War II. They were given to him by a fellow U.S. serviceman.</p>
