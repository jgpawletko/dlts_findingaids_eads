            <p>Samuel Zagat (1890-1964), a Lithuanian-Jewish artist who emigrated to New York City as a child, is best known for his work as a cartoonist: first for his popular comic strip, 
                <title render="italic">Gimpl Beinish</title>, published in the Yiddish-language newspaper, 
                <title render="italic">Varhayt</title>from 1912 to 1919, and later for his political cartoons published in the 
                <title render="italic">Jewish Daily Forward</title>from 1919 until his death in 1964. The 
                <title render="italic">Forward (</title>where he also headed the art department and supervised the newspaper’s weekly rotogravure feature) also published his drawings of street life, court sessions, and theater. His cartoons and drawings also appeared in the 
                <title render="italic">New Masses</title>, 
                <title render="italic">Jewish Morning Journal</title>, and

            <p>Fifty-six 8x10 black and white photographs of people and scenes shot by Samuel Zagat on New York City’s Lower East Side in 1931, just before the Jewish high holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Sukkot. They include images of groups of people and individuals standing or sitting on a pier by a body of water (most likely the East River), many of them holding what are probably prayer books; they appear be waiting to perform the 
                <title render="italic">Tashlikh</title>("casting off") (a Rosh Hashanah custom in which celebrants gather by a body of flowing water and turn their pockets inside-out, symbolically casting off their sins). There are also images of shoppers purchasing lulav and esrog (one a palm frond bound together with willow branches, the other a citrus fruit)–ritual items for Sukkot, from street vendors, as well as merchants offering or shoppers buying skullcaps, shoes, and dishes front outdoor stands. Most locations are not identified, but a few images are labeled "Hester and Essex Streets," or "Orchard Street." A number of the photographs in this collection were published in the 
                <title render="italic">Jewish Daily Forward</title>.</p>
