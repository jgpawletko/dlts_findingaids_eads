            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">The Kentucky Miners' Defense was formed to help free seven miners convicted of murdering three coal company guards in Evart, Harlan County, Kentucky, during a miners' strike in May 1931. Herbert Mahler, director of the organization, spearheaded the publicity campaign to bring national attention to the miners` case. Fund-raising publicity was often aimed at unions and their members, since the Kentucky miners had been attempting to organize, but were being blocked by the coal companies, when the incident took place. The collection spans the years 1931-1939 and consists of 44 photographs, almost all of which are 8x10 black and white copy prints. It is made up of the images of the convicted miners and their families used for publicity purposes by the Kentucky Miners' Defense. There are also views of the area where the strike took place.

            <p>The Kentucky Miners' Defense was formed to help free seven miners convicted of murdering 3 coal company guards in Evart, Harlan County, Kentucky during the miners' strike in May 1931. Herbert Mahler (a former activist in the Industrial Workers of the World), director of the organization, spearheaded the publicity campaign to bring national attention to the miners` case. Fund-raising publicity was often aimed at unions and their members since the Kentucky miners had been attempting to organize when they were violently blocked by coal companies.</p>

Jones and Jim Reynolds; three of the defendants leaving a reformatory with their wives; and 2 portraits of Dolly Hudson Daniels, a dramatic witness for the defense because she was the wife of the chief mine guard who was killed.
