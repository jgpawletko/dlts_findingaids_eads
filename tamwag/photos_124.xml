            <abstract id="ref17" label="Abstract">Jack Doyle was President and Business Agent of Iron Workers Local 40. Doyle took the photographs in the collection between 1968 and 1987, during the course of his work on four major building projects in New York City: World Trade Center Tower 1, 7 World Trade Center, Rockefeller Medical Center, and the J.P. Morgan Building. Doyle kept a camera in his tool kit and made a photographic record of aspects of the work which interested him, including new technology, difficult procedures, and near accidents. Many of the photographs depict the beams and girders that would form the buildings and the cranes and derricks needed to lift them into place. Doyle also took pictures of his friends and co-workers on the jobs. The collection documents the building construction processes of the period and the daily lives of union members.</abstract>

            <p>The collection consists of ninety-one color prints taken between 1968 and 1987, during the course of four building projects in New York City: 7 World Trade Center (38 photographs); World Trade Center, Tower 1 (24 photographs); Rockefeller Medical Center (20 photographs); and the J.P. Morgan Building (10 photographs). Jack Doyle took most of the photos himself, and all were taken with his camera.</p>
            <p>Doyle kept a camera in his tool kit and made a photographic record of aspects of the work which interested him, including new technology, difficult procedures, and near accidents. Many of the photographs depict the beams and girders that would form the buildings and the cranes and derricks needed to lift them into place. Doyle also took pictures of his friends and co-workers on the jobs.</p>
            <p>When the collection was donated in 2002, Doyle and Janet Greene created a list of captions for the photographs, which is also included in the collection. Each photograph has been numbered, and their contents can be determined by using this guide. The captions also frequently elaborate on the procedures shown, indicating what would happen before or after and sometimes including Doyle's reactions. The collection documents the building construction processes of the period and the daily lives of union members.</p>
