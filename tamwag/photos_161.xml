            <abstract id="ref22" label="Abstract">Sam Robert was born in Philadelphia in 1908. He moved to New York City in 1929, and eventually found his way to the motion picture industry. He became a prominent set decorator for movies and commercials and served first as the Vice President of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), Local 52 and later as the Executive Director of the New York Council of Motion Picture and Television Unions (COMPTU). In these positions, Robert advocated for the merger of unions in the motion picture and television industries, encouraged motion picture production in New York City and played a prominent role in the restoration of the Astoria Studios in Queens, NY. This collection consists of approximately two hundred and fifty black and white and color photographs dating from the 1950s through 1990, though the majority are from the 1970s and 1980s. The images document the various activities of IATSE Local 52 and COMPTU, including meetings, rallies, events and participation in the Labor Day Parade.</abstract>
