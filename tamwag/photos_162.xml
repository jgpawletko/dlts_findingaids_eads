            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>The Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW) was formed in Chicago in March 1974, though its origins can be traced to a June 1973 meeting attended by over 3,000 women. The June 1973 meeting, led by Olga Madar of the United Automobile Workers and Addie Wyatt of the United Food and Commercial Workers, was held to discuss the formation of a new AFL-CIO body that would directly address the concerns of women in the labor movement. The organization strives to strengthen the position of women in unions and unite all union women by identifying and advocating against the problems uniquely facing women in the labor force. CLUW currently has an active network of more than 75 chapters, including a chapter in New York City.</p>
