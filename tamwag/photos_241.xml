            <p>The Tamiment Playhouse was a summer theater at Camp Tamiment. The camp, which operated near Bushkill, Pennsylvania from 1921-1965, was an educational and recreational resort affiliated with the socialist Rand School of Social Science. The playhouse was started to provide campers with entertainment, but it soon became a preeminent workshop for theater, dance, film, and television. Many prominent entertainers of the mid-twentieth century counted Camp Tamiment in their training.</p>
            <p>Aura Levitas performed at Camp Tamiment and would later work as a dancer on Broadway and television. Her husband Willard Levitas was a set designer.</p>
