            <p>This unprocessed collection contains correspondence, manuscripts, clippings, printed ephemera and subject files. Although these primarily to Starr's activities outside his official capacity as ILGWU Educational Director, many focus on his unflagging interest in adult and workers education. Letters and documents illuminate educational enterprises he associated with, such as: U.S. Advisory Commission on Educational Exchange (the Fulbright program), the U.S. Information Service, New York City Community College, the Ford Foundation, the Georgia Workers Education Service, Harvard Fellowships for union members, a Labor Extension Service Bill for workers' con¬tinuing education, labor education programs abroad, and the United States Works Progress Administrations Workers' Education Project. Correspondence, memoranda, and clippings document attacks on and response of Public Affairs Committee, publishers of educational pamphlets, to McCarthyist attacks by Friends of Democracy in the early 1950's. Drafts of several PAC pamphlets are included.</p>
            <p>Some correspondence and documents relate to political groups he associated with at various times, including: Americans for Democratic Action (1942-1959), the League for Industrial Democracy (1944-1958), the American Labor Party (1940-1944), the Liberal Party (1944-1957). One box of material on Japan describes post war labor developments and U.S. interest in trade unionism there; one report describes meeting with Douglass McArthur, whom Starr found impressive. There is also correspondence from 1965 tour of Far East. Manuscripts of published material includes drafts of educational material and pamphlets, and manuscripts for approximately eighty unpublished items, including college essays, and eleven book reviews.</p>

            <p>Mark Starr (1894-1985), was the education director of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (1935-1960) and a longtime activist in political and civic affairs. Mr. Starr was the chairman of the Liberal Party in Queens from 1945 to 1959 and was the Liberal candidate for the House of Representatives for the district covering western Queens in 1962. As head of the ILGWU Education Department, he supervised a program that offered 600 classes a year in the United States and Canada, established compulsory educational requirements for candidates for union office,with courses offered in trade unionism and related fields. He was president of the American Federation of Teachers. Workers Education Local 189 (during the 1940s), and served on numerous governmental commissions and boards of directors of civic organizations.</p>
            <p>Mr. Starr, a native of Somersetshire, England, started work at age 13 as a hod carrier. He began his teaching career with the miners in Wales, ran unsuccessfully as a Labor candidate for Parliament and entered this country in 1928. Mr. Starr was the center of a brief but intense public controversy in 1943, when Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia nominated him to be the city's first director of adult education. Mr. Starr was the only one of 100 candidates found qualified by a screening committee, but he was rejected by the Board of Education, with the chairman later saying that Mr. Starr was disqualified by his "long record as a labor protagonist."</p>
