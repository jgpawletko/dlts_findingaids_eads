            <p>Charlotte Stern was born in Haverhill Massachusetts in 1897. Her parents, both emigrees from Russia, were shoe factory workers who moved to East Boston after her birth. Her mother was determined that she receive the best possible education, to equip her to be independent as an adult; she attended Girls Latin School in Boston, and Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Mass., class of 1917. Subsequent to college graduation she worked as a social worker in East Boston, 1918-23, during which period she met and married Bernhard J. Stern.</p>
            <p>She spent the summer of 1923 in New York at the Workers Health Bureau, recruited by Harriet Silverman, WHB Education Secretary, to whom she had been introduced in Boston; then, with her husband, went to Europe. They lived for some months in Berlin and then in London, returning to New York the following year. At that time Charlotte Stern went to work at the Workers Health Bureau as Organization Secretary, in which role she traveled the country speaking at local union meetings and state AFL meetings advocating implementation of health and safety measures for workers. When Bernhard Stern was appointed Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, in 1927, the couple relocated, and she spent one further year affiliated with WHB, concentrating on the west coast. Due to loss of support from underwriting unions the Bureau closed in 1928 and she spent the next two years as secretary of the local International Labor Defense. Its priority then was the release of 10 prisoners from the Washington State Prison at Wala Walla who had been convicted of murder in 1919 after an American Legion-International Workers of the World confrontation at IWW headquarters in Centralia, Wash. in which 4 legionnaires died. She traveled throughout the state under ILD auspices working to rally public support on behalf of the Centralia prisoners under the banner of the Centralia Liberation Committee, at times in cooperation with, other times in competition with the Centralia Publicity Committee organized by Washington state AFL locals.</p>
            <p>In June 1929 six of the Centralia prisoners disavowed the CLC for "capitalizing on our misfortune for selfish political purposes"; this was the culmination of an on-and-off conflict between CLC and CPC over strategy for the release of the prisoners. At about the same time the University of Washington declined to renew Bernhard Stern's contract. Charlotte Stern returned to New York with her husband. She worked at various efforts in the early-mid thirties. In this period she had a child, a daughter, Mira, born in 1931; published, in 1932, Lumber and Labor, and The Injunction Menace, wrote and was briefly an editor for 
                <title render="italic">The Worker</title>, and taught at the Workers School and the Jefferson School.</p>
            <p>In 1936-37 she became an organizer for the Hairdressers and Cosmetologists Local 560B; in 1938-39, education director for the United Office and Professional Workers of America; in 1941, education director for Local 6, Hotel and Club Employees Union. In l944 she became Local 6's "member" on the Executive Board of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee which had been organized in 1942 (successor to several previous groups) to aid Loyalist refugees of the Spanish Civil War. The JAFRC was subsequently accused by members of the U.S. House of Representatives of being a communist front and most of its national officers, including Charlotte Stern, were convicted in 1947 of contempt of Congress and later served jail terms. Charlotte Stern served three months (June-August, 1950). In October 1950 she lost her job with Local 6 when its leadership changed political direction.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Charlotte Todes Stern Papers, spanning the years 1925-1955 have been arranged into eight series, generally chronologically, following the order of Stern's involvement: I. Workers Health Bureau; II. Centralia, Washington Campgain; III. Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee; IV. Writings; V. Trade Union and Labor Education; VI. Womens Committees Membership; VII. Miscellaneous; VIII. Oral History Interview Transcripts. The bulk of the material reflects the Centralia campaign, 1927-30, and the conspiracy charges against the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee by the House Un-American Activities Committee, 1943-50. Additional small amounts of materials pertain to her publications, workers health, education and labor organizing efforts.</p>
            <p>Overall the papers reflect Charlotte Stern's life as a progressive activist rather than strategist. The Centralia-ILD correspondence demonstrates the strategist role played by New York-based ILD leaders; there is correspondence from J.P. Cannon, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Martin Abern, Max Shachtman and others, along with day-to-day Charlotte Stern initiated corespondence which manifests her role as seemingly tireless implementer. These materials reflect as well the relationship between the ILD-directed Centralia Liberation Committee and the Centralia Publicity Committee, agreements and disagreements between them on strategy, and different styles of appealing to the public, etc. Materials from the period also include correspondence to Charlotte Stern from individual prisoners, mimeo appeal letters, minutes and meeting notes, resolutions and petitions.</p>
            <p>The JAFRC materials provide substantial amounts of documentation of the JAFRC/HUAC case, e.g., trial and appeal briefs, opening defense (O. John Rogge) argument draft, press releases and newspaper clipppings from both progressive and general circulation newspapers, as well as an almost complete set of JAFRC Executive Board meeting minutes for the 1943-48 period along with calls to meetings issued by the Committee's Executive Secretary Helen Bryan. These materials differ considerably from the Centralia ones in that they offer little sense of Charlotte Stern's particular involvement. Identifiable as hers though is a set of political remarks incorporated in several draft versions of a speech she planned to deliver before surrendering to the U.S. Marshalls in June 1950. This is the only section of the collection with references to her family life; these appear in some, mostly handwritten, notes of others to her in the immediate pre- and post-jail period.</p>
            <p>Further indications of Charlotte Stern's political interests can be seen in the group of materials organized as "writings." This contains correspondence and reviews related to Lumber and Labor, published in 1932, which focused on working conditions in the lumbering industry, The Injunction Menace, also published in 1932, which dealt with the legal weapons arrayed against labor organizing efforts, and William H. Sylvis and the National Labor Union, correspondence and reviews dating from 1928-45; Sylvis was a 19th century labor progressive. Additional materials here are articles Charlotte Stern published in progressive newspapers and magazines; publication lists and books in print lists including her works; and a series of translations from the German of letters of Rosa Luxemburg, 1916-18, from an edition published in 1946.</p>
            <p>Throughout her career Charlotte Stern functioned primarily as a trade unionist and labor educator. In series #l and #5 can be found materials relating to her work with the Workers Health Bureau, the Hairdressers and Cosmetologists, the United Office and Professional Workers of America and Local 6, Hotel and Club Employees, along with Workers School, A Peoples Institute, etc., catalogs containing Charlotte Stern-taught course listings; and a set of course materials relating to various worker education topics, e.g., understanding a contract, etc.</p>
            <p>Finally, materials evidencing Charlotte Stern's membership in various Womens' Committees of progressive organizations, i.e., the National Council of Soviet-American Friendship, The American Labor Party, the Congress of American Women, and New York Trade Unions have been grouped together as have small amounts of material classified as biographical, miscellaneous correspondence, brochures and leaflets, ranging from 1935 to 1956; included here is a brochure advertising a social security seminar visiting Western Europe and the Soviet Union in the summer of 1937 which Charlotte Stern led, along with some photographs, some reflectiong Local 6 activities, other unidentified. Duplicates and publications have been transferred to the vertical file and serial collections.</p>
            <p>The collection does not provide any indication of the sources of Charlotte Stern's political orientation; researchers should consult oral histories by Ros Baxandall and Dorothy Swanson, part of the Oral History of the American Left Collection, Tamiment Library.</p>
