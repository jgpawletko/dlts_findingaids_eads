He worked in the New York garment industry and joined the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) Local 22. Shortly thereafter, he became its secretary-manager. He was also an organizer for the Joint Board of the Dress and Waistmaker Union. Zimmerman joined the Socialist Party in 1917. Throughout the 1920s, Zimmerman was an active member of the Communist Party, which affiliation cost him his union leadership positions in 1925.
