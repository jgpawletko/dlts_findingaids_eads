            <p>Karen Stamm was an activist in the women's health and reproductive righs movements of the 1970s and 1980s, notably through her role in the Committee to End Sterilization Abuse (CESA) and its successor, the Committee for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse (CARASA). Karen Stamm helped found and at some point chaired committees in both organizations. Both CESA and CARASA were committed to creating a more inclusive reproductive rights movement that took into account the fact that all women did not have equal control of their reproduction and that this choice was in fact limited by race and class. Both rejected the notion that overpopulation was the cause of social and economic ills, called for the end of sterilization abuse as a means of population control, and advocated for the economic conditions that were necessary to undergird economically disadvantaged women’s right to choose freely.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The Karen Stamm Papers document the 1970s and 1980s struggles for reproductive freedom and equality fought by women's health conditions, particularly the Committee to End Sterilization Abuse (CESA) and its successor, the Committee for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse (CARASA). The collection ranges in date from 1946 to 1992, but the bulk of materials date from the 1970s and 1980s. In addition to statements of purpose, meeting minutes and agendas, correspondence, research and resource files, legislative and lobbying campaign materials, newsletters, pamphlets, and other educational and advocacy materials from CESA and CARASA, a mix of materials, mostly newsletters, publications, pamphlets and correspondence of member organizations, organizations they have worked in coalition with, and organizations that have opposed them are also part of the collection. These include the National Women’s Health Network, the Center for Constitutional Rights, the Reproductive Rights National Network, the New York City Health and Hospital Corporation, the Health Policy Advisory Center, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Coalition for the Reproductive Rights of Workers, New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Association for Voluntary Sterilization, Planned Parenthood, and the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare. A large part of the collection consists of newspaper and article clipping files relating mostly to various aspects of sterilization, such as abuse, informed consent, eugenic sterilization, popular and medical attitudes, racial discrimination, and statistics, but also abortion, reproductive rights in the workplace, population control, AIDS, and other health topics.</p>
