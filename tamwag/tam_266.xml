            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Students Organizing Students (SOS) was formed in 1989, in response to Supreme Court's decision in the ruling of Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. Throughout their existence, the organization worked to educate and mobilize young people for reproductive freedom. SOS, along with the National Organization for Women (NOW) and WHAM! (Women's Health Action Mobilization), organized a boycott of Domino's Pizza (Domino's CEO, Tom Monaghan, was a major contributor to right-to-life-organizations) and led to Monaghan's resignation. The organization also held the yearly National Student Conference on Reproductive Rights, a field organizer program, and a training task force on reproductive rights. SOS reorganized in 1992, and broadened their agenda to not only reproductive rights, but to women's health. This included AIDS/HIV awareness programs, date rape, domestic and access to health services to underprivileged groups. The organization was active until 1995 when their material was donated to Tamiment Library.</p>
