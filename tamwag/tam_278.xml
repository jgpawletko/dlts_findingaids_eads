Gollobin worked for the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born from 1936-1982 and served as general counsel for the organization. During the 1980s, Gollobin served on the the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees. He was involved in other left-wing causes, including defending individuals under investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee. The collection contains case files representing Gollobin's work on both immigration and HUAC issues from the 1940s-1990. A significant portion of the collection represents research and advocacy regarding legal issues surrounding immigrant rights and labor. These materials including clippings, correspondence, pamphlets, posters, press releases, pleadings, and reports from nonprofits and government agencies. Prominent themes include labor issues for undocumented workers from Latin America, Haitian refugees, the dragnet raids on undocumented workers in the 1970s, the Rodino immigration bills of the 1970s, and positions of unions and other stakeholders in the ensuing legislative debate.

            <p>Ira Gollobin (1911-2008) was a civil rights attorney who focused on immigration law. Gollobin began working with the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born (1933-1982) in 1936, and he would later serve as general counsel for the organization. During the 1980s, Gollobin served on the the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees. Gollobin also did pro bono work to protect the rights of immigrants and refugees and was involved in other left-wing causes, including defending individuals under investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee.</p>
            <p>Gollobin also authored a book titled

            <p>The collection came to the repository in 2008 and was reboxed at this time. In 2013, minimal processing was undertaken to address preservation issues and provide box level access. Underfilled boxes were consolidated and acidic or dirty folders were replaced with archival folders. This amounted to about two thirds of total folders. Original titles were transcribed. Extensive duplicates and direct mailing advertisements were deaccessioned.</p>
            <p>No archivist-devised arrangement was applied. Description was added at the box level to give researchers a sense of predominant themes and material types, and a finding aid with collection-level notes was written.</p>

                    <p>This box contains several folders on the immigration case of Bill Hokeng Hsieh, a library worker at Columbia University, and his wife Wang Yung Hsieh, an actress and writer. Ira Gollobin represented the Hsiehs when they were deported to the People's Republic of China in 1954, and this box contains a range of documentation for the case, including pleadings, correspondence, notes, and news clippings. Pearl Buck was a supporter of the Hsiehs, and the files also contain correspondence between her and Gollobin.</p>
                    <p>The box also contains materials related to House Un-American Committee hearings, Fifth Amendment issues, and civil rights. Material types include correspondence, news clippings, research, and notes. This includes general background information and files on related to individual cases in which Gollobin was involved. These files primarily date between the mid-1950s-1960s. This box also includes Ira Gollobin's autobigraphical pamphlet 
                        <title render="italic">Winds of Change: An Immigration Lawyer's Perspective of Fifty Years.</title></p>
                    <p>The box also contains many files labeled "Immigration." These materials mostly date from the 1940s-1990s (the bulk being from the 1980s-1990s). These files contain clippings, correspondence, and publications on immigration. Represented organizations include American Friends Service Committee, various agencies of the United States Federal Government, and the American Council for Nationalities.</p>
