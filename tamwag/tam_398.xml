            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>William Addison Price (1915-2009) was a journalist and community organizer. He grew up in Montclair, NJ and flew air-rescue missions for the Navy during World War II, earning the rank of lieutenant. Price’s war experiences inspired him to become a socialist. He joined the 
                <emph render="italic">New York Daily News</emph> in 1940, eventually becoming the paper's United Nations correspondent. In 1948, Price and other members of the Newspaper Guild founded the Newsmen's Committee to Investigate the Murder of George Polk, who was Price's cousin and a fellow journalist. (Polk was murdered in Greece during the Greek civil war by forces allied with the anti-communist government.)</p>
            <p>Price appeared before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, an inquisitorial committee which was investigating allegations that Communists had infiltrated the media, in 1956. The Subcommittee inquired if Price was a member of the Communist Party and if he used the plane he owned as a courier aircraft for the Communist International. Price invoked the First Amendment, rather than the Fifth, and argued that the Subcommittee did not have the right to inquire into his political beliefs. He was fired from the 
                <emph render="italic">Daily News</emph> after testifying before the Subcommittee, and additionally was found guilty of contempt of Congress and was fined and imprisoned. Price's appearance before the inquisitorial committee and its aftermath spurred him to become a participant in the Committee of First Amendment Defendants coordinating committee. He also served as secretary of the New York Council to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee.</p>
            <p>Price later wrote for the 
                <emph render="italic">National Guardian</emph>, covering social issues in New York City and the civil rights movement in the South. In 1981, Price was awarded $10,000 by the Department of Justice after the FBI's "Squad 47" was found to have illegally wiretapped Price and four others on suspicion that they were associated with the Weather Underground. During the 1980s and 1990s, Price was a member and periodic resident of a congregate living house on Fire Island.</p>
            <p>Beginning in the 1970s and continuing into the 2000s, Price worked with a number of community organizations on New York City's Upper West Side to defend tenants' rights and protest the city's urban renewal plans. He was particularly active with the United Tenants Association (UTA), an organization of tenants who lived in buildings in the city's designated West Side Urban Renewal Area (WSURA), and was treasurer of the later dissident subgroup of UTA, the Ad Hoc Committee for Low-Rent Housing. Founded in 1977 by the mostly low-income inhabitants of several city-owned buildings, UTA fought for the right to manage and rehabilitate the buildings in which its members lived, fearing that development in the WSURA would raise rents and push minority groups out of the area. The city's Fifth Amendment to the WSURA plan was passed by the early 1980s and guaranteed UTA tenants the right to rehabilitate the buildings they inhabited as low-rent apartments. However, it was not until 1991 that UTA began renovating the buildings through the city's Mutual Housing Association program (run by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development), thereby forming the United Tenants Association/Mutual Housing Association-Housing Development Fund Corporation, Inc. (UTA/MHA-HDFC, Inc.). Members of UTA’s Ad Hoc Committee contended that UTA’s association with the Mutual Housing Association would cause rents to continually increase and cause further gentrification of the area, as many low-income families in the area had already been relocated by urban renewal. In addition to the dispute between UTA/MHA-HDFC, Inc. and UTA Ad Hoc, UTA/MHA-HDFC, Inc. also brought nonpayment proceedings against Price and other tenants who refused to pay the increased interim rents.</p>

            <p>Some materials from the 2011 accretion (Boxes 16 through 21) were rehoused in archival quality folders shortly after they were donated to the Tamiment Library. Some materials which suffered extensive fire damage may have been discarded during the rehousing process.</p>
            <p>In 2013, the entire collection was assessed for preservation needs. Some materials were placed in new archival quality folders if the original folders were damaging the materials (i.e. if the original folders were dirty or overstuffed). Original folder titles were retained when provided. Any other information on the original folders was photocopied and placed in the new folders. Folder titles added by the archivist are indicated with square brackets. Acid-free paper was used to separate photographs from any acidic materials. In some instances, materials which suffered fire damage were placed in mylar or were separated from other materials with acid-free paper. A folder containing Social Security numbers was redacted with permanent marker. Materials were shifted between boxes to correct understuffing.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The collection, which spans from the 1930s to the 2000s but dates mostly from the 1960s through 1990s, is a rich source of information for researchers interested in tenants’ rights in New York City’s Upper West Side. The collection is predominately comprised of agendas and minutes; proposals and reports; legal documents; correspondence and memoranda; press releases; news clippings; and flyers, pamphlets, and other printed ephemera related to the debates over the development of the city’s designated West Side Urban Renewal Area (WSURA). Most of the materials were generated by the United Tenants Association (UTA), later known as the United Tenants Association/Mutual Housing Authority-Housing Development Fund Corporation, Inc. (UTA/MHA-HDFC, Inc.). The materials document UTA's protests to the city's urban renewal plans for the WSURA and its promotion of the construction of low-income housing. The collection also reflects the internal politics of UTA, particularly the dispute between UTA/MHA-HDFC, Inc. and UTA's Ad Hoc Committee for Low-Rent Housing and UTA/MHA-HDFC, Inc. against Price. Government entities represented in the collection, which UTA and other community groups frequently interacted with, include Community Board #7, the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), and HPD’s Division of Alternative Management Programs (DAMP). The activities of other community groups with an interest in the development of the Upper West Side are also documented, including (but not limited to) the Strycker’s Bay Neighborhood Council, the Community Service Society of New York, the Metropolitan Council on Housing, the 87th Street West Park Association, the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB), and Community Action, Inc. (particularly Operation Move-In). There are also materials generated by the Committee of Neighbors to Insure a Normal Urban Environment (CONTINUE), which, in contrast to most other community group included in the collection, opposed the construction of subsidized housing.</p>
            <p>The collection also speaks to the political environment of the mid-20th century, particularly the civil rights movement and the resistance to anti-Communist investigations. Newsletters, flyers, reports, news clippings, correspondence, and other materials pertaining to the civil rights movement were collected by Price through his coverage of the movement as a journalist and his personal involvement in the cause. Many of these materials were generated by the Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF), as well as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and other activist groups. Two boxes of reel-to-reel recording tapes appear to be mostly of civil rights meetings and events. A significant amount of the collection pertains to activism against the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and other Congressional inquisitorial committees in the form of memoranda and correspondence, flyers, governing documents, press releases, newsletters, and other materials, many created by the National Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee (NCAHUAC) or the group's local New York Council to Abolish HUAC. In a similar vein, there are subject files on First Amendment cases compiled by the Committee of First Amendment Defendants (CFDA).</p>
            <p>To a much lesser extent, the collection includes clippings and correspondence that provide biographical information on Price. Especially noteworthy is Price's family correspondence from World War II, when Price served as a Navy pilot. Materials created by the Communist Party, both national and New York branches, and the Independent-Socialist Party reflect Price’s political affiliations. The collection also serves as a resource for researchers interested in the organization and activism of newspaper unions and offices, as it contains correspondence and other materials from the Newspaper Guild, the Guild's Newsmen's Commission to Investigate the Murder of George Polk, and the 
                <emph render="italic">National Guardian</emph>. A small amount of material relates to Price's time on Fire Island (including the journals he kept while living there) and the "Squad 47" wiretapping case.</p>

                    <p>This box mainly contains Price's correspondence with family and friends. The majority of the correspondence documents Price's World War II service, though many of the letters were written later and pertain to both his personal life and his various activism interests. Correspondents include Price's parents, his nephew George Jefferson Price III ("Jeff"), and Judith Gregory. Some of Price's World War II correspondence, along with news clippings and photographs from his service and clippings and publicity materials from the National Conference for New Politics, appear to have been collected by Price for a scrapbook.</p>
                    <p>This box also contains materials related to Price's journalism career, including reports and memoranda on changes at the 
                        <emph render="italic">National Guardian</emph> and reports, correspondence, newsletters, and news clippings related to the work of the Newspaper Guild's Anti-Discrimination Committee.</p>
                    <p>Evidence of Price's activism in opposition to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) is also present in the form of news clippings on an April 1961 rally to abolish HUAC and memoranda, minutes, petitions, newsletters, press releases, and notes created by the National Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee (NCAHUAC) and its local New York Council. Some of the materials document the fraught relationship between the national and New York groups.</p>
                    <p>To a much lesser extent, the box contains campaign material promoting the Progressive Party and Henry A. Wallace's 1948 run for president; First Amendment subject files on Arthur Miller and Otto Nathan containing news clippings, correspondence, and photographs; newsletters, correspondence, and reports produced by the American Veterans Committee (AVC), including a report written by Price for AVC titled "The Negro Doctor in Montclair and His Relationship to Montclair Hospitals;" documentation from a civil suit between Price and his siblings against their sister, Harriet Price; and correspondence and other material related to a family reunion Price helped organize in Oxford, New Jersey.</p>

                    <p>About half of the materials in this box relate to housing rights issues. The materials document the work of the United Tenants Association (UTA), later the UTA/Mutual Housing Association-Housing Development Fund Corporation (UTA/MHA-HDFC, Inc.), and other housing rights organizations during the 1970s through 1980s in the form of UTA Steering Committee minutes and UTA proposals, memoranda and correspondence, official statements, reports, and publicity materials, as well as collected news clippings. Many of the materials relate to the development plans for the West Side Urban Renewal Area (WSURA), particularly the UTA and the Strycker's Bay Neighborhood Council's interactions with Community Board #7 and the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) regarding WSURA. There is also material generated by the UTA Ad Hoc Committee for Low-Rent Housing, which documents the Ad Hoc Committee's opposition to the UTA/MHA program and the dispute between the Ad Hoc Committee and UTA/MHA-HDFC, Inc. Correspondence, legal documents, and other materials from the 1990s provide evidence of Price's dispute regarding the rehabilitation of his apartment under the Mutual Housing Association Program (MHAP).</p>
                    <p>The other half of the box contains Price's correspondence and notes from Fire Island; legal documents and correspondence with lawyer Harry Rand and others regarding the U.S. v. Price First Amendment case; legal documents, photographs, and news clippings from the Price v.
