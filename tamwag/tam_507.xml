            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The Tamiment Library Labor Unions and Organizations Web Collection, first began in 2007, contains websites of local New York and national labor unions, especially those whose records are held by the Tamiment Library's Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives (designated by the New York City Central Labor Council as the official repository for their member unions' records). The collection also contains websites of labor movement related organizations, e.g. organizations that support the goals/activity of organized labor and social and economic justice for working people; and websites that promote democracy within labor unions. Some of these organizations are multi-issue organizations, besides labor activism, some organizations work for women's rights, environmental causes, and labor history and education. These websites contain a huge variety of media, which include YouTube videos, pdfs, blog postings (including Tumblr and Wordpress blogs), petitions, news feeds, audio, and other media. These websites often act to document and update upon the organizations’ activities, schedule upcoming events, build awareness of their causes, or other media. Most websites are captured quarterly, but during periods of rapid update, the website are captured weekly or monthly. The links in the container list take the user to the main Web Archiving Service (WAS) page for each website, which contain more detailed description of each website.</p>
            <p>The web collection documents the publicly available content of the web page, it does not archive material that is password protected or blocked due to robot txt exclusions. Although attempts are made to completely archive the entirety of a website, linked pages are often not captured, as can be pages within the host URL.</p>
            <p>The types of materials in the web collection--publications, news listings, leaflets, and other materials that publicize events and activities--were formerly collected in analog form by Tamiment librarians and archivists are increasingly being published online. Therefore, it is important to capture these websites to document the activities of these unions and organizations.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Tamiment Library, New York University, a special collection documenting the history of United States radicalism, labor, and progressive social action, began web archiving in 2007 as part of a grant given by the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIPP) of the Library of Congress, as part of a project to preserve born-digital political communication. As most unions, left movements, progressive organizations, and others stop creating ephemeral material and paper based collections and move most of their administrative and informational material to the web, Tamiment felt the need to continue to document the changing face of the labor and left movement into the web era. Tamiment uses the California Digital Library’s Web Archiving Service (WAS) as their tool to capture and preserve websites. WAS was created in 2007 and Tamiment is one of its earliest partners. The California Digital Library hosts the storage and infrastructure to the project. This service employs open source web archiving utilities developed by Internet Archive with the support of the The International Internet Preservation Consortium.</p>

            <p>Tamiment Library uses the California Digital Library’s Web Archiving Service (WAS) to capture websites for historical purposes. WAS is a subscription service and provides a storage infrastructure and technical assistance, while Tamiment archivists select websites for capture based on Tamiment’s collecting policy. After websites have been selected, the archivist determines the collection/project the website falls into. After the site is added, the title of the site is sometimes changed to better reflect the name of the organization/project/event/site. Sites are crawled by what are commonly known as spiders, robots, or crawlers to index the website. WAS uses a crawler called Heritrix. These crawlers “capture” the website at a certain moment in time. Sites are captured for up to 36 hours and the host page only. The first capture and sometimes yearly captures are set to capture the host page and the linked pages, which will travel up to twenty-five pages from its host page. Websites are crawled quarterly, unless contemporary events cause rapid change to content on a website. This is an assembled collection, websites are chosen by the archivists. The archivist describes each site using subject headings, a brief description of the site and its contents, and tags. WAS arranges the websites alphabetically and preserves the websites.</p>

                        <p>The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), founded in 1937, is a national labor union representing performers, journalists and other artists working in the entertainment and news media. AFTRA's scope of representation covers broadcast, public and cable television, radio, sound recordings, “non-broadcast” and industrial material, as well as Internet and digital programming. AFTRA advocates on legislative and public policy issues that directly affect members’ wages and working conditions. This includes lobbying and support for such issues as ownership consolidation in the broadcast industry, Equal Employment Opportunity laws and regulations, copyright and performance rights issues, “non-compete” restrictions, OSHA and local safety regulations, and more. AFTRA also represents artists and journalists in judicial proceedings, often as amicus, and before the U.S. Copyright Office. In 2012, AFTRA merged with the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) to form SAGAFTRA.</p>

BWFJ was founded in 1981.

Local 1153 advocates for many issues, including job losses, job pressures, seniority rights, the creation of new job titles, health and safety, and discrimination based on sex and race.</p>

                        <p>The Employee Free Choice Act was a legislative bill that was introduced into both chambers of the U.S. Congress on March 10, 2009. The bill's purpose was to, “amend the National Labor Relations Act to establish an efficient system to enable employees to form, join, or assist labor organizations [unions], to provide for mandatory injunctions for unfair labor practices during organizing efforts, and for other purposes.” This website was a petition website in support of the act. The central part of the legislation would have provided for automatic certification of unions if a majority of potential members had signed unionization cards</p>

                        <p>Labor Notes, founded in 1979, is a non-profit organization and network for rank-and-file union members and grassroots labor activists. Though officially titled the Labor Education and Research Project, the project is best known by the title of its monthly magazine. The magazine, both print and online, reports on news and analysis about labor activity or problems facing the labor movement. In its pages it advocates for a revitalization of the labor movement through Social Movement Unionism and union democracy. [Labor Notes is widely believed to have been an initiative of the International Socialist Organization, a Trotskyist group with organizations in the United States and other countries.]</p>

The Guild conducts campaigns to support progressive and democratic library activities; supports activist librarians as they work to effect changes in their own libraries and communities; bridges the gaps between school, public, academic and special libraries, and between public and technical services; encourages debate about prevailing management strategies adopted directly from the business world and to propose democratic forms of library administration; considers the impact of technological change in the library workplace; monitors the professional ethics of librarianship from a perspective of social responsibility; and facilitates contacts between progressive librarians and other professional and scholarly groups in the record keeping field. The Guild publishes a journal, the Progressive Librarian.</p>

The factory closed in October 2009. This website was a support page for the strike which posted news and other information.</p>

                        <p>Women on the Job (WOJ) was founded in 1981 as a private, not-for-profit advocacy organization dedicated to achieving women’s equality in the workplace on Long Island. WOJ was a project of Resources for Program Development, Inc. (RPD), which had been established with funding from the North Shore Unitarian Universalist Society VEATCH Program. The WOJ program was initiated in October 1981 by co-founders Lillian McCormick and Charlotte Shapiro. Its mission was to foster equal employment opportunities for women and combat workplace discrimination against women in Long Island communities.</p>
