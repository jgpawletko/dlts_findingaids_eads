            <p>The Nicaragua Solidarity Network (NSN) of Greater New York was formed in 1985, initially as a sub-organization of New Yorkers for Peace in the Gulf. The NSN formed from over twenty-five small grassroots organizations in New York that came together in response to President Ronald Reagan's trade embargo on Nicaragua in 1985. The NSN worked to support the Sandinista Revolution, and to protest U.S. support of the counter-revolutionary military movement, aka the Contras, who also killed civilian supporters of the revolution, targeting medical and educational personnel in particular. Delegates from these small groups met at monthly meetings, and with a grant from the North Star Foundation, were able to establish a newsletter, the 
                <emph render="italic">NicaNews</emph>. Among its member organizations were the New York-Nicaragua Construction Brigade, which organized groups of volunteer workers who went to Nicaragua.</p>
