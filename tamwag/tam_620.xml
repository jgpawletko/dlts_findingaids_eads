            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The collection is mostly comprised of copies of materials related to Emma Goldman generated during Goldman's lifetime. These primary materials were collected and often annotated by Alice Wexler in the course of conducting her research and include news articles, correspondence written to or by Goldman, and flyers. Wexler's notes on sources she consulted and her transcriptions of primary materials also make up a large portion of the collection. Several photographs of Goldman taken throughout her life, as well as photographs of her family and other well-known anarchists like her friend Alexander Berkman, are also featured. The collection contains a VHS tape labeled "Emma Goldman," two cassette tapes labeled "Ahrne Thorne" from 1982, and two microcassette tapes containing interviews with anarchist newspaper editor Ahrne Thorne, anarcho-syndaclists Sam and Esther Dolgoff, and others from 1983 and 1984. Additionally, there are two annotated books, 
                <emph render="italic">The Tragedy of Spain</emph> by Rudolf Rocker (1986) and 
                <emph render="italic">Emma Goldman: Anarquista de ambos mundos</emph> by Jose Peirats (1978).</p>
