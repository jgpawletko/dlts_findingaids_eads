            <p>The collection contains files related to the activities of the Social Service Employees Union (SSEU), Local 371, primarily during the 1970s. A large potion of the papers focus on Local 371's legislative advocacy and its support of Local 420's Health and Hospitals Corporation strike. Christian and/or anti-Coummunist publications and correspondence also make up a significant part of the collection. To a lesser extent, there are also publications from a number of civil rights organizations.</p>

            <p>Patrick Knight served as president of the Social Service Employees Union (SSEU), Local 371, from 1974 to 1976. SSEU Local 371 is part of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), AFL-CIO. The union primarily represents New York City workers in the social service professions. During Knight's tenure as president, Local 371 was particularly focused on reintegrating Income Maintenance programs with social service programs within the Human Resources Administration of the City of New York (the programs became separated in 1970). Knight was also the Secretary-Treasurer of Local 371 from 1970 to 1974. He was active in politics outside of his political involvement on behalf of SSEU, and served as a delegate to Wisconsin Democratic Conventions in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
