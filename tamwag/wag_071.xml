            <head>Audiovisual Access Policies and Procedures</head>
            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@library.nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>

            <p>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) Local 3882 is a New York City local of the national labor union representing teachers. Locally known as the United Staff Association (USA) of New York University, the branch won representation of office, clerical, technical, and laboratory employees at NYU in December 1978. The USA negotiated its first contract in 1979, with year-to-year contracts in place until 1983. The union hired its first full-time employee, an organizer in August 1984. Presidents of the local have included Christine Russell (1978-1980), John Kraft (1980-1985), and Margarita Aguilar (1985).</p>
