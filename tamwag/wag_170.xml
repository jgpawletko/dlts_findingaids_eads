Over the course of his career, O'Donnell achieved many victories for transit and postal workers.

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>John Francis O'Donnell (1907-1993) was a New York City lawyer who achieved many victories for labor unions over the span of his 55-year career, particularly for striking transit and postal workers. Born in Donegal, Ireland, O'Donnell was a supporter of the Irish Republican Army. Around age 20, British authorities caught O'Donnell carrying a pistol. He moved to New York to avoid getting into any further trouble with the British government.</p>
            <p>O'Donnell worked various odd jobs after moving to New York, including elevator operator, grocery store clerk, and writer of newspaper editorials for 
                <emph render="italic">The Irish Echo</emph>. He attended night classes at Fordham University, earning his law degree in 1937. O'Donnell formed a law partnership with Asher Schwartz in 1948 and later formed an affiliated law firm in Washington specializing in labor law and union clients.</p>
            <p>In the 1930s, O'Donnell became an aide and friend to City Councilman Michael J. Quill, who would go on to found and lead the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU). O'Donnell began serving as the TWU's general counsel in 1948, a role he held until his death. He played a key role in the 1980 New York City transit strike, helping to secure pay increases for bus and subway workers.</p>
            <p>In addition to his work with the TWU, O'Donnell was the chief lawyer for the American Postal Workers Union. In this role, he sought to protect postal workers' retirement benefits and attacked the use of part-time workers, as workers feared part-time work would threaten full-time positions.</p>
            <p>O'Donnell's daughter, Eileen Ginn, wrote a biography of O'Donnell, 
                <emph render="italic">A Man from Bruckless</emph>, published in 2010.</p>

            <p>Some materials may have been removed from the Transport Workers Union of America Records (WAG 235) by Tamiment staff in 1985 to form the John Francis O'Donnell Papers (WAG 170).</p>
            <p>Eileen Ginn, John O'Donnell's daughter, made an additional donation of materials in 2011. The accession numbers associated with this gift are 2011.081 and 2011.105.</p>

            <head>Audiovisual Access Policies and Procedures</head>
            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item's original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection's finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@library.nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>

            <p>In 2011, a Tamiment staff member did some initial rough arrangement and description of the collection. Some of the folder titles and annotations on the folders were provided by this staff member.</p>
            <p>Photographs separated from this collection at the time of accessioning were established as a separate collection, the John Francis O'Donnell Photographs (PHOTOS 285). In 2014, the photograph collection was reincorporated into the John Francis O'Donnell Papers (WAG 170).</p>

                    <p>The other half of the box contains information on O'Donnell's family history and biographical information on O'Donnell's early life and education, compiled by Eileen Ginn for her biography of O'Donnell. Ginn's correspondence and notes written in the course of conducting her research are also included. O'Donnell gave numerous speeches, often in the form of radio broadcasts, on Irish Republicanism and other topics, and transcripts and notes he made in preparation for his speeches are also present.</p>

The TWU materials relate mostly to specific locals and the TWU's collective bargaining agreement with the New York City Transit Authority and the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority. TWU constitutions from the 1940s to 1980s are also present. Additionally, there is a small amount of material related to the Utility Workers Union of America and the Communications Workers of America, as well as court transcripts of the 1951 open hearings before the Mayor's Special Transit Committee on the transition to a forty-hour work week.</p>
                    <p>A 1936 letter from Irish Republican Army leader George Gilmore to O'Donnell, along with a typed transcription (likely created by Ginn), is also included.</p>
