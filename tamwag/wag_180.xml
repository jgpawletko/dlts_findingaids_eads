Most of its members’ work is fabricating, rigging, and installing metal signboards. This has included production of many of the electric signs on Broadway’s “Great White Way,” the time ball used at New Year’s Eve celebrations at Times Square, as well as signs for suburban shopping centers. Its charter was issued in 1924, but the Local was founded earlier, possibly as early as 1911. The Collection includes correspondence, Executive Board minutes, apprenticeship records, contracts, and a small number of photographs, mainly from the 1970s and 1980s.</abstract>

            <p>Sheet Metal Workers International Association, Local 137 is the Greater New York, Long Island, Westchester and Rockland local union of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers. Its charter was issued in 1924, as part of what was then the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers’ International Alliance, but the Local was founded earlier, possibly as early as 1911. Local 137 originally organized workers doing custom automobile body work, but most of its members soon shifted to the skilled work of fabricating and erecting metal signboards (although portion also have worked in production shops making stove tops, electric metal components, and lockers). In collaboration with members of New York City area electricians’ and painters’ union locals, Local 137 employees fabricated many of the electric and neon signs on Broadway’s “Great White Way,” and as well as (as employees of of ArtKraft Strauss, one of the premiere sign-making companies in the United States) the time ball that has descended each year at the New Year’s Eve celebration on Times Square). Local 137 members have also produced signs, billboards, and banners for well-known New York City locations such as Yankee Stadium and Kennedy Airport, and worked on the restoration of several New York City landmarks, including the Apollo Theater and Nathan’s Famous Hotdogs. Members have also worked in the New York City metropolitan area, as far afield as New Jersey. The collapse in 1970 of the Broadway Central Hotel, in which the Local's offices were located, destroyed some of its earliest records. The Local purchased its own building in Woodside, Queens, in 1983.</p>
            <p>Local 137 members are required to complete a five-year apprenticeship training program that offered by the Local.</p>
            <p>Presidents of the Local have included Moe Rosen, Bernard Friedlander, Martin Fruchter, William Fotiadis, and Paul Collins, Jr.</p>
