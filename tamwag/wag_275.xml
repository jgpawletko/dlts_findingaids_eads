            <p>The collection contains correspondence (including two letters from Harry Bridges of the ILWU with reply by Margolin), ephemera, photographs, several honorable discharge certificates from the Coast Guard and Department of Commerce, and two honorary plaques. The materials pertain to Julius Margolin's work in various unions and organizations, including the International Longshoremen's and Warehouseman's Union (ILWU), New York City Central Labor Council, Council of Motion Picture Arts and Television Unions (COMPTU), and Local 52 IATSE. A small amount of photographs depict Margolin at rallies and protests, and with Gerry Adams at an event sponsored by the Irish-American Labor Coalition. Also included are 2 CDs, one (mis-labeled "I Don't Want To Be A Soldier") containing one audio file, "Are You Ready To Fly?", another containing biographical information titled, "A Union Man: The Life and Work of Julius Margolin".</p>
