            <p>Brenda Berkman is a pioneering female firefighter who worked for the FDNY from 1982-2006. She is a founding member and former president of the United Women Firefighters (1982-1986) and served as trustee of the Women in Fire Service (1983-1992). Berkman was born in 1951 and became interested in firefighting as a young girl. She earned her B.A. from St. Olaf College in Minnesota, an M.A. in History at Indiana University, a J.D. from New York University Law School, and an M.S. in Fire Protection Management from the City University of New York. At the time of her application to the New York Fire Department she was a law student at New York University.</p>
            <p>Berkman taught at the FDNY fire academy and the United States National Fire Academy. Her many awards and honors include the Susan B. Anthony award from the National Organization for Women (1984), a Revson Fellowship on the Future of the City of New York from Columbia University (1987-1988), the distinguished alumni award from St. Olaf College, and the National Organization for Women's Women of Courage Award (2002). For her support of labor history and labor archives, she was honored by the New York Labor History Association in 2005. In 2006 Berkman retired from firefighting in 2006 and shifted to a career in the arts. In 2008 she began studying printmaking at the Art Students League (New York, NY). Most of her work is in stone lithography (drawing on and printing off a stone) and copperplate etching which has primarily been inspired by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</p>
            <p>Berkman was a featured participant in the PBS program, "Sex, Power, and the Workplace" (1992) and was the subject of the Off-Broadway play, "Firework" (2002). Her story and that of her fellow women firefighters is the focus of the documentary, "Taking the Heat: The First Women Firefighters of New York City" (2006). She was promoted to Captain in 2002, only the third woman to achieve that rank.</p>
