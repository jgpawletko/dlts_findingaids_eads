            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Sol Yurick (1925-) is an American novelist born to a working class family of politically active Jewish immigrants, but became disillusioned with politics after the 1939 Hitler-Stalin pact. He studied at New York University after the war, majoring in literature. After graduation, he took a job with the welfare department as a social investigator, a job he held until the early 1960s, when he took up writing full time. Much of his work involves speculative political and social commentary. He was involved in Students for a Democratic Society and the anti-war movement at this time.</p>
